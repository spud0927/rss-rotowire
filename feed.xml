      <title>Kyle Pitts caught 7-of-10 targets for 62 yards in the Falcons’ Week 7 loss to the 49ers.</title>

      <description>Pitts was clearly a large part of the offensive game plan against the Fred Warner-less 49ers, seeing consistent targets as quarterback Michael Penix continually dealt with aggressive pressure from Robert Saleh’s defense. He was unable to generate meaningful yardage as his longest reception went for only 19 yards, but fantasy managers can take solace in the fact that he tied for the team lead with 10 targets. The early returns from Pitts unfortunately mimic his previous two seasons and not his breakout rookie year, making him a shaky TE2 ahead of a solid on-paper matchup against the Dolphins in Week 8.</description>

      <title>Drake London caught 4-of-10 targets for 42 yards in the Falcons’ Week 7 loss to the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ffaf-df81-ab9b-ffef88cd0000</link>
      <description>London tied with tight end Kyle Pitts for the team lead in targets but was highly inefficient with his looks. In fairness to him, most of that was due to poor play from quarterback Michael Penix, who had no real answer for consistent pressure from Robert Saleh’s aggressive 49ers defense. Even so, London’s modest returns are worrisome considering they coincide with the return of Darnell Mooney to the lineup, something that has been a trend since the start of the 2024 season. Up next for London and the Falcons are the Dolphins at home in Week 8.</description>

      <title>Christian McCaffrey rushed 24 times for 129 yards and two touchdowns in the 49ers’ Week 7 win over the Falcons, adding 72 yards on seven receptions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ffb2-d99b-a1dd-ffbe53df0000</link>
      <description>McCaffrey quite literally put the team on his back against the Falcons, scoring both touchdowns while also leading the team in receiving. The return of tight end George Kittle appeared to do wonders for the room McCaffrey had prior to first contact, with the 139-yard outburst on the ground marking the first time since Week 1 in which he managed more than 57 yards rushing. Up next for the All-World veteran is a difficult matchup against the Texans on the road in Week 8.</description>

      <title>Mac Jones completed 17-of-26 passes for 152 yards and one interception in the 49ers’ 20-10, Week 7 win over the Falcons, adding 11 yards on five carries.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ffb5-da18-a39b-ffb7a2c00000</link>
      <description>Almost half of Jones’ 152 yards through the air were accounted for by running back Christian McCaffrey in a game the two teams combined for only 616 yards of total offense, but the veteran journeyman again did enough to will the 49ers to another victory. Jones is now 4-1 as a starter for the 49ers, playing through injury the previous two games while keeping the team tied with the Rams atop the NFC West. The box scores haven’t always looked pretty, but Jones continues to do his job by keeping the team competitive until Brock Purdy’s eventual return under center. It is unclear if he will be tasked with another start in Week 8, but fantasy expectations should be held in check should his number be called against a tough Texans team.</description>

      <title>Jauan Jennings caught 4-of-7 targets for 31 yards in the 49ers’ Week 7 win over the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ffbb-da18-a39b-ffbb41c40000</link>
      <description>Jennings continues to gut through multiple injuries, this time finishing one target off the team lead behind running back Christian McCaffrey. Even so, a muted game environment in which the two teams combined for only 616 yards of total offense led to only 26 pass attempts from quarterback Mac Jones, leaving Jennings’ fantasy returns of little interest. Up next is a difficult matchup with a stout Houston defense in Week 8.</description>

      <title>Kendrick Bourne caught both targets for 14 yards in the 49ers’ Week 7 win over the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ffbd-d99b-a1dd-ffbdce820000</link>
      <description>After amassing 284 yards the previous two games while working as the top pass-catcher, the returns of Jauan Jennings and George Kittle left Bourne with only two targets on a night quarterback Mac Jones attempted only 26 passes. It is clear that Bourne is capable of returning solid counting stats when he serves as the top option through the air, but that might not be the case as the team continues inching closer to full health. Bourne should remain on fantasy benches ahead of a Week 8 meeting with the Texans.</description>

      <title>George Kittle failed to catch either of his two targets in the 49ers’ Week 7 win over the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ffc0-d651-a9df-ffd555420000</link>
      <description>Kittle left fantasy managers with a nice goose egg in his return from injured reserve but made his presence felt while helping to spring running back Christian McCaffrey for a season-high 129 yards on the ground. This was the first game all season in which the 49ers played with both Kittle and fullback Kyle Juszczyk for the duration of the game, and the returns were sparkling - at least as the team was concerned. Kittle remains unlikely to command elite volume but maintains a lofty weekly ceiling considering his per-catch upside, making him a wide range of outcomes play ahead of a meeting with the stout Texans in Week 8.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports “no changes are expected at this time” for the Dolphins this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0196-d99b-a1df-3b9e7a8e0000</link>
      <description>This could be in reference to the future of Mike McDaniel, whose Dolphins sit at 1-6 on the season, but the recent performances out of Tua Tagovailoa are also drawing plenty of criticism. Things have unraveled quickly for the fourth-year head coach, who is rapidly approaching a second-consecutive losing season after going 8-9 last season, and Tagovailoa is sitting on a 1,313-11-10 passing line and is coming off back-to-back three-interception performances. In Week 7’s loss to the Browns, the Dolphins looked completely disinterested in the 31-6 defeat, raising plenty of questions for all involved in this disaster. While changes aren’t expected at this time, it goes without saying that another performance like what we saw in Week 7 could force a big change in one way or another.</description>

      <title>Jets HC Aaron Glenn said he is undecided on who will start at quarterback in Week 8 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-01f9-da18-a39a-dbfbc2210000</link>
      <description>We would expect Glenn to eventually name Tyrod Taylor the starter for Week 8’s game against the Bengals, but given his often vague nature at the podium and steadfastness in defending Justin Fields, this may not be a decision we get until later in the week. Fields was benched favor of Taylor entering the second half of Sunday’s loss tot he Panthers, and while the offense as a whole didn’t fare much better, Taylor at least got the passing game moving in a forward direction. Regardless of who is under center for the Jets, we wouldn’t expect the end result to look much different when they take on Bengals team that has shown some life with Joe Flacco now at the helm.</description>

      <title>Jets HC Aaron Glenn said “I hope that he plays” when asked about Garrett Wilson (knee) being available for Week 8 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0216-d651-a9df-6b1771140000</link>
      <description>Hope don’t float, and Glenn was quick to follow up his semi-optimistic comment with acknowledging that he will wait to see what the doctors have to say about Wilson’s health entering the week. Wilson suffered a knee injury in the Jets’ Week 6 loss to the Broncos and was a DNP in practice all of last week. It was reported a week ago by ESPN’s Adam Schefter that Wilson is expected to miss “a couple weeks,” suggesting he’s at least one more week removed from a return. It’s possible something has changed over that time, but Glenn, whose Jets sit at 0-7, is searching for answers in multiple areas, including this one. Wilson’s status will be one to watch for when the first injury report is released on Wednesday.</description>
