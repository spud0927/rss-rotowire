      <title>Texans HC DeMeco Ryans said “as of right now I don’t know that” when asked if he expected Joe Mixon to remain with the team in the future.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d7d5-d56e-afff-f7fd5f380000</link>
      <description>Ryans continues to downplay any conversation surrounding Mixon, who missed all of the 2025 season with a foot injury. It was reported in late December that some of Mixon’s issues stemmed from some procedures he got “on his own, away from the Texans,” which could complicate his future with the team and the contract he signed that will keep him with the team through 2026. It’s impossible to say where things truly stand with Mixon and the Texans right now after Ryans and the team spent a full season avoiding the topic, but it seems unlikely he would return to the team next season given how things have played out since Mixon was mysteriously injured last offseason.</description>

      <title>Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said “I’m not getting into that right now” when asked about an extension for QB C.J. Stroud.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d7d8-d968-a19b-dff9166c0000</link>
      <description>It is just a day after the Texans’ season ended, so it’s an unsurprising non-answer. It’s still noteworthy that the answer wasn’t exactly an affirmative, no-questions-asked, yes. “There is a lot of negative talk right now and he understands that,” Ryans said in an answer about how his message to Stroud is to block out the noise. Stroud’s catastrophic playoff performance will likely leave him getting his fifth-year option picked up this offseason, but neither Stroud nor the Texans should exactly be giddy about negotiating off his 2025 season. We’d be surprised if a long-term extension was coming before the conclusion of 2026 — if it comes at all.</description>

      <title>Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said he’s “excited to see [Tank Dell] back on the field next year.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d7dc-d35e-a1bf-d7deb5d10000</link>
      <description>Dell missed the entire season after tearing his ACL, MCL, and LCL against the Chiefs in Week 16 of the 2024 season. The fact that the head coach is still optimistic is noteworthy, and Dell probably will slot in as Houston’s No. 2 receiver in 2026 assuming he bounces back and is fully recovered from the surgeries. Dell’s return, should it come to pass, will be a development that will make it hard to see Jayden Higgins or Jaylin Noel boosting their fantasy stock in 2026.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero said he’d “watch” Broncos quarterbacks coach Davis Webb as a potential candidate for the Bills head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d7eb-d35e-a1bf-d7ebd7070000</link>
      <description>“He’s really close to Josh Allen,” Pelissero says while noting the Bills are focusing on a more offensive-minded coach. Apparently multiple teams are waiting for the Broncos to be eliminated to get Webb in for a second interview per Pelissero’s reporting. Based on that, it sure seems likely that the 30-year-old former NFL quarterback stands a good chance of leaving the cycle with a head-coaching gig. The NFL Network reporter also says that Joe Brady is “a candidate, but I don’t know if he isthecandidate” in Buffalo.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero says “the teams to watch” for former Bills head coach Sean McDermott are Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and Tennessee.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d804-d968-a19b-d8f52a8b0000</link>
      <description>“It doesn’t make a ton of sense for him to go into a total rebuild” per Pelissero, who rules out Arizona and Las Vegas as landing spots for McDermott. Pelissero mentions that McDermott would be outside of the normal bucket the Steelers hire from, and says Baltimore “makes a lot of sense” while the Titans brass has mutual ties to McDermott from his work with Andy Reid. Seeing McDermott coach Lamar Jackson might be the funniest idea we’ve ever heard of, so of course we’re for it. The Titans also seem like a reasonable landing spot.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Vikings DC Brian Flores will interview with the Steelers on Tuesday for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d807-d35e-a1bf-ddc7d3780000</link>
      <description>Flores has long been considered a potential replacement for Mike Tomlin, and will now have a chance to meet with the team he spent the 2022 season with under Tomlin. The former Dolphins head coach has spent the last three seasons as the Vikings’ defensive coordinator, and over that span, elevated the defense from one of the worst in the league to being a top-10 unit. In addition to fielding head coaching requests from the Steelers and Ravens, Flores has also met with the Commanders to discuss their defensive coordinator vacancy. If he’s unable to land a head coaching job, the option to return to Minnesota remains on the table, but Flores is in high demand after turning in one of his strongest years as a coordinator to date.</description>

      <title>Dolphins completed an interview with Raiders DC Patrick Graham for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d810-d968-a19b-d8f1de370000</link>
      <description>The Dolphins are the first team to meet with Graham as a potential head coaching fit this cycle. The long-time defensive coordinator was in the same role with the Dolphins during the 2019 season, but has spent the last four seasons as the Raiders’ defensive coordinator despite the team going through three head coaching changes over that span. Graham’s defense allowed the fourth-lowest yards per carry on the ground last season, but ranked 25th in points allowed and 14th in total yards allowed. Graham becomes the eighth coach to interview with the Fins for their head coach opening. We’ll see if he’s one of the few called back for a second interview in the coming days.</description>

      <title>49ers EDGE Mykel Williams (knee) said he “should be” ready to go right around training camp.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d81c-d968-a19b-d8fdb5760000</link>
      <description>It sounds like Williams, who tore his ACL in early November, should be ready for the start of the season based on that timeline. He’ll be penciled in next to fellow injury returner Nick Bosa as the 49ers two starting EDGE players next year. Williams managed one sack in nine starts during his rookie season, adding 20 tackles.</description>

      <title>Chiefs hired Bears RB coach Eric Bieniemy as offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d81f-d968-a19b-d8ff695e0000</link>
      <description>Apparently, there wasn’t much to think about when deciding whether Andy Reid would be interested in running things back with Bieniemy. Bieniemy was a member of Reid’s coaching staff from 2013 to 2022 and served as offensive coordinator beginning in 2018 until leaving for the Commanders during the 2023 offseason. During Bieniemy’s time as OC, the Chiefs never finished worse than sixth in scoring, although some of that could also be a direct reflection of the team having Tyreek Hill in his prime to stretch the field and make defenders miss. Last year’s offensive coordinator, Matt Nagy, saw his contract expire at the end of this season and he is in the mix for multiple head coaching opening across the league. The Chiefs had their worst offensive season of the Patrick Mahomes era in 2025. Hopefully, an infusion of young talent this offseason coupled with the return if Bieniemy can lead to a bounce-back for an offense that was among the league’s best the last time he coached the team.</description>

      <title>TitansInsider’s Terry McCormick believes it “sure feels like” Matt Nagy is the frontrunner for the Titans head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d836-d56e-afff-fefef1e30000</link>
      <description>49ers DC Robert Saleh is meeting with the Titans this afternoon and giving his final sales pitch. McCormick adds that Packers DC Jeff Hafley may get “full-court press[ed]” by the Dolphins this afternoon before he can get to Tennessee. Nagy and the Titans have been a rumored pair for a long time — it was one of the first names to emerge after the firing of Brian Callahan. Perhaps the sudden availability of Sean McDermott will get the Titans to keep things cool for a bit — it sure doesn’t feel like anyone else is as imminently interested in hiring Nagy as they are, as the Titans are the only place so far we have with a reported second interview for the former Chiefs OC. Or perhaps this is going to wrap up in short order. Stay tuned.</description>
