      <title>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said Quentin Johnston has cleared concussion protocol.</title>

      <description>Johnston’s role in the offense remains murky after the Keenan Allen addition. We suspect that Johnston will be battling the inconsistent Tre’ Harris for snaps and targets outside, but either way this is probably only news for DFS contests at the moment.</description>

      <title>Jaire Alexander (knee) did not practice Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-06be-db7b-a5dd-a6be15490000</link>
      <description>We’re in midseason form. Alexander has not practice since August 9th per The Athletic’s Jeff Zrebiec. There’s still plenty of time for him to get cleared this week, but nobody should be surprised if Alexander misses Week 1 after this long of a layoff.</description>

      <title>Isaiah Likely (foot) did not practice on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-06ac-de13-afdd-46ef3a310000</link>
      <description>Likely underwent foot surgery on August 1 and hasn’t been on the field since. The fourth-year tight end avoided opening the season on injured reserve, suggesting he will be able to return before Week 4, but he’s far from a lock to play in Week 1 against the Bills. The Ravens don’t have to release their first official practice report until Wednesday, which should give us a better sense of Likely’s availability for Week 1. Even if he is active, he’ll be hard to rely on in fantasy with Mark Andrews still operating as the team’s top tight end.</description>

      <title>Rams coach Sean McVay said he expects Matthew Stafford (back) to start against the Texans in Week 1.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-06ed-db7b-a5dd-a6eda16b0000</link>
      <description>We’re expecting Stafford to continue to be managed through practices, but so far his back injury doesn’t seem like it’ll keep him from setting foot on the field on opening day. Jourdan Rodrigue of The Athletic said recently she believes the injury is going to need to be managed throughout the season, so Stafford is probably best-approached as a risky QB2 in superflex leagues at this time. For a quarterback who is very bound to the pocket, a first-game test against Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter presents a real challenge.</description>

      <title>Rams HC Sean McVay said Alaric Jackson returned to practice on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-06c9-de13-afdd-46cb4eb60000</link>
      <description>Jackson was diagnosed with blood clots in June, but has been trending toward being ready for Week 1. The fact that he was able to suit up for a Monday practice suggests he’s still trending in the right direction, and the team said the plan will be to start him in Week 1 against the Texans if all goes well this week. Jackson earned a PFF pass blocking grade of 79.5 last season, allowing just three sacks and 22 pressures on 502 dropbacks. If he is unable to start, D.J. Humphries looks like the most likely candidate to step up in Jackson’s absence.</description>

      <title>Trevon Diggs said there’s a 75-80 percent chance he plays in Week 1 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0704-d332-a1fd-9736aa9a0000</link>
      <description>The Cowboys open the season on the road against the Eagles on Thursday night. The veteran corner’s status was reported as “up in the air” earlier by NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, and that appears to still be the case based on Diggs’ comments. Diggs said earlier that he would be ready to go by Week 4 at the latest, but his practice availability will give us a better look at how he projects for the week.</description>

      <title>A.J. Brown (hamstring) was not listed on the Eagles’ injury report on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-070e-de13-afdd-47cf16930000</link>
      <description>It would appear that any concerns over Brown’s hamstring injury lingering into the regular season can be laid to rest. The star receiver was not only a full participant in practice, but avoided the injury report altogether, which is a great sign for his Week 1 availability when the Eagles kick off the season against the Cowboys on Thursday night. Brown profiles as a fringe WR1/WR2 against a Cowboys defense that will be without Micah Parsons following his trade to the Packers and may also be short CB Trevon Diggs (knee).</description>

      <title>Eagles OG Landon Dickerson (back) did not practice on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0732-de13-afdd-47fbc5800000</link>
      <description>Dickerson didn’t practice on Monday, but there seems to be some hope that he will still suit up on Thursday night when the Eagles play host to the Cowboys. Dickerson was listed on the team’s official report with a back injury, but had been missing time after undergoing a minor knee procedure in mid-August. It was reported over the weekend that Dickerson was “trending” toward playing in Week 1, so we won’t read too much into Monday’s DNP just yet.</description>

      <title>Trevon Diggs (knee) was listed as a full participant in Monday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0737-de13-afdd-47ff531d0000</link>
      <description>The day started with Diggs’ Week 1 availability being “up in the air.” Later, the veteran corner said there was a 75-80 percent chance he would suit up. Now, we know that Diggs was a full participant in Monday’s practice, which would seemingly increase his chances of playing in the season-opener. Diggs is definitely trending toward a return, and said on Monday he felt good when speaking to the media. It’s too early to say for certain if Diggs will play, but this is an encouraging start to the week for him.</description>

      <title>Chargers RB Najee Harris (eye) said he’s ‘ramping up to it’ when asked if he will play Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0749-dbe3-a9bb-375b4ddc0000</link>
      <description>Speaking to reporters Monday, Harris said “I feel good though, and we’ll just see where it leads.” Harris has been on the practice field for almost a week now as he works his way back into football shape following a July 4 fireworks incident. He continues to claim the injuries to be superficial, insisting he is doing everything he can to be on the field Friday in Brazil against the Chiefs. He also noted that his vision has not been affected but did not want to go into details about the circumstances of the incident. While Harris is certainly trending in the right direction to play in the team’s season opener, his potential workload is a topic of another discussion considering the time he has missed during camp and preseason.</description>
