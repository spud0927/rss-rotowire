      <title>Patrick Mahomes completed 22-of-30 passes for 257 yards and three touchdowns in the Chiefs’ 30-17, Week 6 win over the Lions, adding 32 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries.</title>

      <description>Mahomes played an inspired game, marching the field and converting when he had to and delivering the grit in other situations. His second quarter rushing score from one yard out falls in the latter bucket, which allowed the Chiefs to double the Lions up around the break after tacking on another score on their first possession of the second half. It was that 14-point spurt that put the Chiefs up for good. Mahomes has continued to have to overcome a largely nonexistent run game as he still leads the team in rushing through six weeks, but the team gets standout wide receiver Rashee Rice back after his six-game suspension culminated with the win, giving Mahomes his top option through the air back ahead of a Week 7 divisional tilt against the Raiders.</description>

      <title>Isiah Pacheco rushed 12 times for 51 yards in the Chiefs’ Week 6 win over the Lions, catching one target for zero yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dbad-d94a-a79d-dbadb1630000</link>
      <description>Pacheco’s earth-shaking running style was on full display in this one as positive game script allowed the Chiefs to give the veteran back second half carries as they began to ice the game. Pacheco was kept out of the end zone for the sixth consecutive game, this time watching as Mahomes scored from one yard out just before the half. With volume unlikely and a shrinking red zone role, Pacheco is nothing more than trade fodder in fantasy circles as we approach the halfway point in the season.</description>

      <title>Kareem Hunt rushed six times for 23 yards in the Chiefs’ Week 6 win over the Lions, adding 11 yards on one reception.</title>

      <description>The team turned to Isiah Pacheco over Hunt as they looked to ice the game in the fourth quarter, but it was quarterback Patrick Mahomes that scored on the ground from one yard out just before the half for the team’s only rushing score of the game. Hunt can’t be treated as anything more than a touchdown-dependent FLEX unless there is an injury ahead of him this season.</description>

      <title>Travis Kelce caught 6-of-7 passes for 78 yards in the Chiefs’ Week 6 win over the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dbb3-def2-abdb-dff375df0000</link>
      <description>Kelce caught Patrick Mahomes’ first pass attempt for a 15-yard gain on the team’s first possession to set the tone for the evening, shaking free up the middle on multiple occasions to return his best yards per reception and total yardage outing of the season. It will be interesting to see how the tam incorporates Rashee Rice back into the offense as the second-year wide receiver is due back from a six-game suspension in Week 7 against the Buccaneers. It could leave Kelce with a muted role until later in the season when games begin to bear more weight.</description>

      <title>Hollywood Brown caught all four targets for 45 yards and two touchdowns in the Chiefs’ Week 6 win over the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dbb7-d94a-a79d-dbbfcb690000</link>
      <description>It was the first multi-touchdown game since the 2021 season for Brown, who shook free on two crossers near the end zone for easy scores in this one. Brown’s role is almost assuredly set to change with Rashee Rice due back to the field in Week 7 after serving his six-game suspension. Brown could be relegated to prayer FLEX status moving forward.</description>

      <title>Xavier Worthy caught 2-of-4 targets for 20 yards and a touchdown in the Chiefs’ Week 6 win over the Lions, adding six yards on one carry.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dbbb-def2-abdb-dffb24a90000</link>
      <description>Worthy continues to gut out multiple injuries after playing through a dislocated shoulder and ankle injury for the previous three games, this time finding the end zone early in the first quarter to put the Chiefs on the board. It will be interesting to see how the team handles the return of Rashee Rice in Week 7 considering the state of the pass-catching corps at present. Worthy sees a slight bump down to WR4 range with the return of Rice.</description>

      <title>Chimere Dike caught 2-of-3 targets for eight yards in the Titans’ Week 6 loss against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dd7f-dd4c-afb9-ffff1c590000</link>
      <description>Dike, who has primarily played as a kicker returner this season, saw his playing time spike with Calvin Ridley (hamstring) sidelined against the Raiders. He ran a route on 31 of Cam Ward’s 46 drop backs. The speedy Dike — who’s been targeted on a strong 23 percent of his routes this season — could see more opportunity in the coming weeks if Ridley remains sidelined. He’s someone to monitor on deep league waiver wires.</description>

      <title>Tyler Lockett caught 1-of-3 targets for zero yards in the Titans’ Week 6 loss against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dd88-d94a-a79d-dd8dd6080000</link>
      <description>That gives Locket a grand total of three receptions over his past four games. With Calvin Ridley possibly missing time with a hamstring injury, look for Chimere Dike and Van Jefferson to see an increase in playing time and targets. Lockett has seen a target on a paltry 12 percent of his routes in 2025.</description>

      <title>Rashee Rice is eligible to return from suspension in Week 7 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dd8a-dd4c-afb9-ffcbddb20000</link>
      <description>Rice served a six-game suspension after violating the league’s personal conduct policy. Rice pleaded guilty to two felonies relating to a multi car crash he was involved with last year. It will be Rice’s first taste of game action since Week 4 of last season, but the third-year receiver was on a tear before his season-ending knee injury. In what amounted to essentially three games played, Rice caught 24 passes for 288 yards and two touchdowns on 29 targets. Rice was involved with the team throughout training camp and should be up to full speed or close to it. We’ll conservatively project him as a WR2/WR3 in his first return to action against the Raiders.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Buccaneers WR Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) will undergo an MRI on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ddad-db72-a199-ffef8cff0000</link>
      <description>According to Rapoport, the hope is Egbuka’s hamstring injury isn’t as significant as the one Mike Evans suffered in Week 3 against the Jets, but the star rookie is still likely to miss some time. It’s yet another blow to a Buccaneers receiving corps that has now seen its top three receivers go down during the first month and a half of the season, which could give way to Kam Johnson and Tez Johnson serving as the top two wide outs in Week 7 when the Bucs take on the Lions. We should know more on Egbuka’s status after his MRI.</description>
