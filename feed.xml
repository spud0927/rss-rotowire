      <title>Steelers WR Calvin Austin (calf) was limited in Friday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1484-d1bc-a3fb-95a4b1c60000</link>
      <description>It was a mid-week downgrade, never a great sign. Austin played a season-low 16 offensive snaps on Sunday with new additions Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Adam Thielen taking bigger roles, so he’s droppable in most leagues.</description>

      <title>Vikings TE T.J. Hockenson (shin) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 15 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-146d-d005-a9bf-dc7dd66f0000</link>
      <description>Hockenson is good to go for the Vikings’ intriguing game against the Cowboys this weekend, though he can only be viewed as a low-end TE1, at best. The veteran tight end finished as the overall TE14 in half-PPR scoring in consecutive weeks.</description>

      <title>Broncos OL Mike McGlinchey (shoulder) is questionable for Denver’s Week 15 game against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1487-d005-a9bf-dcb735790000</link>
      <description>McGlinchey popped up on the injury report as a Friday DNP after being healthy earlier in the week. Not auspicious. Geron Christian and Frank Crum are the backup tackles on the roster for Denver, and one of them could be pressed into service on Sunday if McGlinchey can’t go.</description>

      <title>Browns DT Mason Graham (rib) is questionable for Cleveland’s Week 15 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-148d-d77b-adfb-de8ffd560000</link>
      <description>Graham was limited on Friday, but didn’t practice on either Wednesday or Thursday. He did play through the injury in Week 14 against the Titans. The rookie No. 5 overall pick has a 68.8 PFF defensive grade in 572 snaps this year.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-148d-d77b-adfb-de8ffd560000</guid>

      <title>Packers RB Josh Jacobs (knee) is questionable to play in Week 15 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-148e-d77b-adfb-de8fcb150000</link>
      <description>Add backup RB Emanuel Wilson wherever available. Jacobs is seemingly on track to play on Sunday, but it cannot hurt to be safe. Wilson operated as the team’s featured running back with Jacobs sidelined against the Vikings a few weeks ago, rushing 28 times for 107 yards and two touchdowns. The Broncos’ elite defense will put up a fight, but Wilson would be a volume-based RB2 if Jacobs cannot play.</description>

      <title>Packers RB MarShawn Lloyd (calf/hamstring) is listed with a new injury and has been ruled out for Week 15 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1488-d005-a9bf-dcbc1f640000</link>
      <description>Brutal. The Packers placed Lloyd on injured reserve with a hamstring injury in late August. He picked up a calf injury while on the injured reserve list, delaying his return. The Packers opened his 21-day practice window on December 1st. He resumed practicing in a limited capacity after that, but was sidelined today, and is now listed with a new hamstring injury. The development could jeopardize his rest-of-season availability.</description>

      <title>Packers WR Matthew Golden (wrist) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 15 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-149c-d8cf-affb-bcbe40fa0000</link>
      <description>Golden is good to go for his fantasy-unfriendly role as a rotational wide receiver. Golden could catch a long pass, but he does not have the snap share requisite for season-long, re-draft FLEX consideration. He does not need to be rostered at this time.</description>

      <title>Packers WR Jayden Reed (shoulder) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 15 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-149c-d8cf-affb-bcbe3b400000</link>
      <description>Reed and WR Dontayvion Wicks (ankle) are ready to rock against the Broncos this week. Both players are forced to play efficiently thanks to the team’s deep receiving corps, but Reed can still be started in the FLEX. Wicks is a bit more volatile, but is capable of making big plays.</description>

      <title>49ers RB Christian McCaffrey (illness) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 15 against the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-14b0-d77b-adfb-deb3e7f70000</link>
      <description>McCaffrey practiced fully on Friday after logging a limited session on Thursday. He can be treated as an elite RB1, per usual, against the Titans this week. He leads the NFL with 322 touches this season, boasting 59 missed tackles forced per PFF.</description>

      <title>Steelers TE Darnell Washington (concussion) was limited on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-14e0-d77b-adfb-dee316cc0000</link>
      <description>That is unfortunate. One would hope to see Washington increase his participation every day, as he works his way through the NFL’s five-phase concussion protocol. It is possible he stalled out in the third phase. Hopefully, he upgrades to full tomorrow and can be on the field when his team faces the Dolphins on Monday night.</description>
