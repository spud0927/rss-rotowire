      <title>Jameson Williams caught his lone target for nine yards in the Lions’ Week 5 victory over the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b701-deb6-a7fd-f7df7c040000</link>
      <description>Williams struggled against the Browns in Week 4, but the team kept trying deep shots to the 24-year-old wide receiver. They just couldn’t get on the same page. Against the Bengals, the Lions never pressed the issue because they simply didn’t have to. Sam LaPorta got things started on the first drive. Jared Goff had no problem connecting with Amon-Ra St. Brown. David Montgomery threw a touchdown pass to Brock Wright. The Lions took a 28-3 lead in the second half with Jamo’s primary contribution coming on some key blocks while his teammates had the ball. Detroit is paying Williams enough that they expect more production, but they just haven’t needed it on the current four-game winning streak. Williams will continue to be a boom/bust WR3 against the Chiefs in Week 6.</description>

      <title>Bam Knight rushed four times for 11 yards in the Cardinals’ Week 5 loss to the Titans, adding one catch for 13 yards.</title>

      <description>Knight was involved in the Cardinals’ offense as they try to replace James Conner and Trey Benson in the aggregate. He only saw 11 snaps, but scored a goal-line touchdown on one of his touches. It will be tough to trust him for consistent fantasy production moving forward, but it is notable that he is the early-down backup to Michael Carter based on Week 5’s usage.</description>

      <title>Jaydon Blue rushed four times for seven yards in the Cowboys’ Week 5 win over the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b703-dca3-a9fb-bf9bddbe0000</link>
      <description>Blue played well behind Javonte Williams in his pro debut. The rookie fifth-rounder saw just four of the Cowboys’ 24 rush attempts on the day, with his longest gain coming on a six-yard carry. Fantasy managers stashing Blue can continue to do so while Miles Sanders (ankle) remains sidelined, but they shouldn’t expect much from him in Week 6 against the Panthers.</description>

      <title>Marvin Harrison Jr. caught 4-of-5 targets for 98 yards in the Cardinals’ Week 5 loss to the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b704-deb6-a7fd-f7dfec630000</link>
      <description>Harrison was clicking with Kyler Murray early on, catching three of his four total receptions on the first two drives of the game. He caught a sky ball in double coverage for a 43-yard gain, landing just shy of the goal line on the team’s first possession. After that, he was hardly heard from again as the Cardinals offense turned anemic. Fantasy managers will be hoping for big plays or a score from Harrison for good fantasy output. He is a high-end WR3 against the Colts for Week 6.</description>

      <title>Jalen Tolbert failed to catch his lone target in the Cowboys’ Week 5 win over the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b706-d6e9-af9d-bf96ba2e0000</link>
      <description>Tolbert was a non-factor in this one. The early PFF data credits Tolbert with 46 offensive snaps to Ryan Flournoy’s 36, but it was Flournoy who tied for the team-high nine targets in Sunday’s win, while Tolbert was an afterthought. Tolbert is sitting on a 10-101-0 line on 19 targets through the first five weeks. Fantasy managers can’t depend on him in Week 6 against the Panthers.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b706-d6e9-af9d-bf96ba2e0000</guid>

      <title>Isaac TeSlaa caught his lone target for a 12-yard touchdown in the Lions’ Week 5 win over the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b709-d95b-addb-ff4f3b140000</link>
      <description>TeSlaa’s touchdown came in the fourth quarter. With the Bengals getting off the mat to pull within 11 points, the Lions led another touchdown drive. TeSlaa finished it off catching a 12-yard pass from Jared Goff. It’s just his third career catch in five games and first that necessitated him using both hands. It’ll take an injury to another Lions pass catcher for TeSlaa to make fantasy starting lineups this year.</description>

      <title>Isaiah Davis rushed once for five yards in the Jets’ Week 5 loss to the Cowboys, adding four receptions for 28 additional yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b709-d6e9-af9d-bf99d3770000</link>
      <description>Davis did most of his damage through the air in Sunday’s loss. The second-year back consistently picked up chunk gains on his four receptions, but his light work in the rushing game won’t do much to excite fantasy managers heading into Week 6 against the Broncos. Davis remains an interesting stash as the next man in line behind Breece Hall, but we’ll need to see more consistent touches before putting him in our fantasy lineups.</description>

      <title>Trey McBride caught 5-of-7 targets for 41 yards in the Cardinals’ Week 5 loss to the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b709-dca3-a9fb-bf99646c0000</link>
      <description>McBride continued to be Kyler Murray’s target between the sticks, leading the team with 7 total targets. He totaled just 41 yards and is still suffering from lack of touchdowns. McBride has an elite floor from his usage and will be in the TE1 range for Week 6 against the Colts.</description>

      <title>Patriots RB Antonio Gibson (knee) limped off the field in the second quarter of Week 5 against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b719-dca3-a9fb-bf9928bd0000</link>
      <description>Gibson was hit low on a kickoff return in the second quarter and remained down on the field as the two teams scrambled to gain possession of his fumble. He was not carted off and there was no immediate update passed by the broadcast team, but the area of the leg he was grabbing is typically indicative of ligament stress in the knee. It would be shocking if he returned to the game in Week 5. Gibson took six carries for 21 yards and caught his lone target for five yards prior to departing, with the increase in workload induced by yet another lost fumble by Rhamondre Stevenson.</description>

      <title>Michael Wilson caught 2-of-4 targets for 16 yards in the Cardinals’ Week 5 loss to the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b71c-d95b-addb-ff5ef5bd0000</link>
      <description>Wilson continues to be involved as the Cardinals’ No. 2 wide receiver. However, the offense’s inconsistencies make that role low value for fantasy purposes. It was technically a season-high in yards for Wilson, but that just shows the low ceiling he has for fantasy purposes. Wilson should be off fantasy radars for now.</description>
