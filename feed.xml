      <title>Colts placed DL DeForest Buckner (neck) on season-ending injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5be4-dc7a-af9b-dfff57310000</link>
      <description>He re-aggravated his neck injury in Monday night’s loss to the 49ers. Steichen said that Buckner will undergo surgery next week and that he “expects Buckner to play again next season.” Buckner has a $26.6 million cap hit in the last year of his contract in 2026 and might be a candidate for a restructure given how this year went. His age-31 season ends with 10 starts, four sacks, and 47 combined tackles.</description>

      <title>Harold Fannin (groin) is questionable for Week 17’s game against the Steelers after being added to the injury report on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5bf1-d56e-afff-fff9662e0000</link>
      <description>It’s never a good sign when a player is added to Friday’s injury report. A soft-tissue injury creates even more cause for concern. Until we hear otherwise, Fannin should be considered as legitimately questionable for Week 17’s game against the Steelers, which is bad news for a Browns offense that is already down David Njoku (knee). In addition to Fannin, backup QB Dillon Gabriel (shoulder) was also added to Friday’s injury report and is listed as questionable. CB Myles Harden (shoulder), DT Sam Kamara (elbow), and OG Wyatt Teller (calf) are also listed as questionable for this weekend.</description>

      <title>David Njoku (knee) was ruled out for Week 17’s game against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5bf3-dc7a-af9b-dfff073c0000</link>
      <description>Njoku will miss his third-straight game due to a knee injury that he suffered in Week 14. The Browns are at risk of being down their top two TEs with Harold Fannin (groin) being added to Friday’s injury report. We’ll see if Njoku can get back on the field in time for Week 18’s season finale against the Bengals.</description>

      <title>Colts coach Shane Steichen said Sauce Gardner (calf) will play in Indianapolis’ Week 17 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5bf2-d35e-a1bf-5ff228c40000</link>
      <description>Gardner has not played since injuring his calf in Week 13’s loss to the Texans. He had not practiced at all until Friday’s session. This strikes us as a bit of a desperate play, which makes sense as the Colts are a loss away from elimination. If Gardner can play up to his talent for the whole game, he’ll likely lower Brian Thomas’ upside in Week 17.</description>

      <title>Browns listed RB Dylan Sampson (hand) as questionable for Week 17 against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5bf3-d35e-a1bf-5ff3b5980000</link>
      <description>We still don’t know the specifics of Sampson’s hand injury that sidelined him for Weeks 15 and 16, but the rookie running back practiced every day this week and has a good chance of seeing a lead role for the Browns if he’s active. Sampson served as the Browns’ RB1 all the way back in Week 1, and wound up catching eight passes for 64 yards while adding another 12-29-0 on the ground. Sampson would have some appeal as an RB3/FLEX option if he’s available for this week’s fantasy championships. If Sampson is able to go, Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams would likely split backfield duties.</description>

      <title>Colts coach Shane Steichen said he expects LT Bernhard Raimann (elbow) to “give it a go” in Indianapolis’ Week 17 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5bf5-d56e-afff-fffd22a10000</link>
      <description>The Colts will likely be forced to throw often against a pass-funnel Jaguars defense in Week 17, so whatever Raimann give them could be an upgrade on Luke Tenuta in a game where they’ll need to keep Jacksonville’s pass rushers away from Statue Phil Rivers. It does sound like there’s a chance he will sit or that he’s at a re-aggravation risk based on this wording.</description>

      <title>Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said Kayshon Boutte (concussion) will not play in New England’s Week 17 game against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5bfa-dc7a-af9b-dfff79820000</link>
      <description>Boutte did not practice all week and is in some danger of being shut down for the remainder of the regular season, particularly if the Patriots don’t need to battle for seeing in Week 18. His absence will leave Kyle Williams with a big role against the Jets.</description>
