      <title>Chiefs coach Andy Reid said Isiah Pacheco (knee) “may take more time.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6f7f-d45b-affe-7fff92270000</link>
      <description>Don’t be surprised if we aren’t seeing Pacheco at practice this week, in other words. Coming off the bye, we were expecting to see Pacheco return to the lineup, but if that doesn’t happen, Kareem Hunt will be on the RB2/RB3 borderline against the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said MJ Stewart (quad) will be placed on season-ending injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6f91-d673-a39e-ef9182e60000</link>
      <description>No surprise after Stewart was carted off. Myles Bryant replaced Stewart against the Jaguars in Week 10. It’s possible Jimmie Ward could eventually take the role after he recovers from foot surgery.</description>

      <title>Eagles activated LB Nolan Smith ahead of Week 11’s game against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6f79-d45b-affe-7fffb8f30000</link>
      <description>Smith suffered a triceps injury in Week 3’s win over the Rams and has been sidelined ever since. The third-year pro totaled 10 tackles and one forced fumble in the three games he appeared in this season, and totaled a career-high 6.5 tackles last season. He should immediately slot into his normal role on Monday night against the Packers.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Rich Cimini reports Garrett Wilson will miss 3-4 weeks with a knee sprain.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6fb1-d673-a39e-efb152f30000</link>
      <description>Wilson’s return from injury was cut short when he re-aggravated the same knee injury that forced him to the sidelines in Week 6 against the Broncos. It’s a tough blow for one of the league’s worst offenses, which will now look to guys like Adonai Mitchell, John Metchie, and Josh Reynolds to lead a pass offense that has been grounded for much of the season. A four-week absence would mean Wilson could have a chance to suit up in Week 15 against the Jaguars. Given the current state of the Jets’ season, it will be interesting to see if the team opts to play him when healthy or sideline him for the rest of another lost season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Nick Wagoner believes “it’s clear the 49ers don’t intend to make [Brock] Purdy active again until he’s healthy enough to reclaim his starting job.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6fb4-d673-a39e-efb5f85d0000</link>
      <description>So here are the facts on the ground: After the Giants game last week, Kyle Shanahan “acknowledged that Purdy likely wouldn’t return to full health at any point this season as he deals with turf toe.” Shanahan later said “Our dilemma or what we’re trying not to do is put him out in the situation we did versus Jacksonville six weeks ago ... I do believe he’s closer and further along than what he was at that time. Hopefully he’ll have a chance this week.” What does it mean to be healthy enough? Purdy certainly didn’t play well against the Jaguars in Week 4. But if he’s never going to be fully healthy again this season, it doesn’t take an expert between-the-lines reader to see a scenario where Mac Jones simply keeps starting every week. Especially if the 49ers continue losing and fall out of playoff contention. We’re not saying that this is what is going to happen. But it shouldn’t be surprising if the 49ers continue to start Jones. As Wagoner puts it: “Purdy could, hypothetically, reach 90% health but is that better than Jones at full strength? It would be easy enough for the 49ers to continue riding with Jones given the possibility Purdy could struggle or, worse, reaggravate the toe injury again.”</description>

      <title>Bills HC Sean McDermott said he will continue to stick with Joe Brady as offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6fb9-d713-ad9e-6ffd91460000</link>
      <description>A 13-point performance against a bad Dolphins team is just the latest flop for a Bills team that has scored 20 or fewer points in its three losses this season. Brady replaced offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey during the 2023 season and helped fix an offense that was falling well short of what we’d expect from a Josh Allen-led attack. Now, it’s Brady’s offense that’s struggling to take advantage of Allen’s skillset, as the Bills currently rank 23rd in deep pass attempts and 24th in dropbacks through the first 10 weeks of the season. At some point, Brady should lean more into his MVP quarterback who ranks in the top six among his peers in both EPA per dropback and offensive success rate.</description>

      <title>Cardinals WR Zay Jones suffered a torn Achilles in Week 10’s loss to the Seahawks and will be out for the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6fc2-d45b-affe-7fd6e24f0000</link>
      <description>Jones felt his Achilles pop in Sunday’s loss and was assisted off the field by medical trainers. The nine-year vet has caught 12 passes for 183 scoreless yards this season and re-upped with the Cardinals on a one-year deal earlier this offseason. The 30-year-old receiver will now have surgery to repair his Achilles, but could be set to join a team next offseason once healthy.</description>

      <title>Steelers waived S Juan Thornhill.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6fce-d45b-affe-7fde83430000</link>
      <description>Thornhill will now hit waivers but will be free to sign with any team if he goes unclaimed. The veteran safety joined the Steelers on a one-year contract this offseason after previously playing for the Browns. Thornhill has totaled 23 tackles and one pass breakup this season while playing primarily as a backup.</description>

      <title>49ers hosted free agent CB Asante Samuel Jr. for a visit.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6fdd-d713-ad9e-6fdde2980000</link>
      <description>Samuel continues to make his rounds with teams in search of his services. The fifth-year corner was medically cleared to return to play after undergoing a spinal fusion surgery, and could help any secondary in need of a boost before the postseason. Samuel has started 47 of the 50 games he’s appeared in during his career, totaling 176 tackles, six interceptions, and 37 pass breakups.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan is hopeful that Ricky Pearsall (knee) will practice this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6ff1-d713-ad9e-6ff58a230000</link>
      <description>Pearsall has missed six straight games since suffering a PCL strain in Week 4. The injury has kept him from the practice field for several weeks, so a return in any capacity would be a good sign at this point. Pearsall has totaled 20 receptions for 327 scoreless yards in the four games he appeared in this season.</description>
