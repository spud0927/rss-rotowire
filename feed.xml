      <title>A.J. Brown caught 6-of-9 targets for 80 yards in the Eagles’ Week 6 loss to the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc39-dd4c-afb9-eff90dfe0000</link>
      <description>Brown’s six receptions tied a season high, while his 80 yards were his second most. He also notched a 30-yard reception, just his second of the year. All decent enough developments, but these shouldn’t be notable milestones for a superstar wideout. This is a struggling offense right now, and AJB is bearing the brunt of it. Jalen Hurts seems more comfortable throwing to Dallas Goedert and DeVonta Smith. Although it’s tempting to think that could be some kind of reaction to Brown’s moaning about not getting the ball, the reality is that Brown faces the toughest coverage and is the toughest target to hit for a quarterback currently struggling through the air. Things don’t figure to get a whole lot better against Brian Flores’ pass defense in Week 7, but perhaps Philly can burn gambling Flores on some of his riskier calls.</description>

      <title>DeVonta Smith caught 4-of-5 targets for 49 yards in the Eagles’ Week 6 loss to the Giants.</title>

      <description>That’s already a disappointing statline before you learn Jalen Hurts missed Smith for what should have been a walk-in, 89-yard touchdown. It’s just been that kind of year for Philadelphia’s passing game. Smith also appeared to tweak his left leg, but he received minimal medical attention and was never announced with an injury. If he’s sore tomorrow, he will still have nine more days to rest up for Week 7 against the Vikings. A secondary target in an offense struggling for big plays through the air, Smith is more of a WR3 than WR2 until further notice.</description>

      <title>Wan’Dale Robinson caught 6-of-7 targets for 84 yards and a touchdown in the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc40-db72-a199-fe4b6cd00000</link>
      <description>Robinson’s 84 yards were his most since Week 2 and second most of the season. He finally had a big day in Malik Nabers’ absence. His touchdown was a 35-yarder where Jaxson Dart got outside the pocket, improvised, and found Robinson. The wideout then broke a tackle near the goal line to secure the six points. The Giants are trying to limit their passing volume as Dart learns the NFL game — and keeps calling his own number as a rusher — but Robinson will continue to see the most of it. He’s more of a top-40 option than true WR3 ahead of Week 7 against the Broncos, but Robinson can be justified in most fantasy lineups.</description>

      <title>Theo Johnson caught 2-of-4 targets for 27 yards in the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc43-d94a-a79d-cd4f613b0000</link>
      <description>Coming off a two-score Week 5 and generating some fantasy buzz, Johnson had a quiet night in a huge Giants upset victory. One of his missed connections was a rough third down drop. Despite the recent scoring binge (three TDs between Weeks 4-5), Johnson has still yet to surpass 34 yards receiving. He’s established a bare-minimum floor but hasn’t really hinted at a ceiling ahead of Week 7 against the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Tyrone Tracy rushed four times for six yards in the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc46-dd4c-afb9-efc73a3c0000</link>
      <description>Active for the first time since Week 3 as the G-Men pulled off a stunning upset victory, Tracy got out-touched 21-4 by Cam Skattebo, who generated 110 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns. Pro Football Focus charted Tracy as playing just 21 snaps to Skattebo’s 49. Four touches is probably Tracy’s absolute floor, but it’s tough to say he’s a 1B back at this time. Skattebo has taken over the backfield, and Tracy is a second-tier contingency back as a fumbler in an offense that would be wary of giving him big workloads in the event of a Skattebo injury.</description>

      <title>Lil’Jordan Humphrey caught 4-of-8 targets for 55 yards in the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc49-db72-a199-fe4b3ae60000</link>
      <description>Elevated from the practice squad with Darius Slayton sidelined with a hamstring injury, 27-year-old journeyman Humphrey somehow matched a career high with his eight looks. Several of them came in the end zone, where Humphrey unfortunately committed a drop. He also drew a defensive holding call. We’re sure the Giants were happy with the effort from a role player on short notice, but this could easily be the last time all year you hear Humphrey’s name.</description>

      <title>Jalin Hyatt caught 3-of-5 targets for 17 yards in the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc4c-def2-abdb-dd6d66320000</link>
      <description>Yet to catch a pass on three targets this season coming into this evening, Hyatt got more run with Darius Slayton (hamstring) sidelined. Unfortunately, he got out-targeted 8-5 by practice squad elevation Lil’Jordan Humphrey. Hyatt also had something of an end zone drop that thankfully resulted in a DPI call that set the Giants up for a one-yard Cam Skattebo touchdown. In theory a big-play threat who could be a little livelier down the stretch as this offense perks up with Jaxson Dart under center, the reality is Hyatt seems extremely unlikely to ever make re-draft fantasy noise.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Chris Godwin (fibula) is not expected to play in Week 6 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ce21-dd4c-afb9-efe127780000</link>
      <description>Godwin has been a DNP all week with a fibula inury that comes a week after he returned from the fractured fibula he suffered in 2024. Back-to-back DNPs to open the week served as the early sign that he would miss Week 6’s game against the Niners, but Fowler’s report suggests the veteran receiver will officially be ruled out before the weekend. We’ll check back in once the Buccaneers give word on Godwin’s availability, but his absence would give a slight boost to Sterling Shepard’s fantasy stock for those in deep leagues in need of a dart throw.</description>

      <title>Breece Hall said “I want to be here. I want to be a New York Jet” when asked about any trade rumors surrounding him.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ce8f-def2-abdb-dfef54a00000</link>
      <description>It’s not often you hear people admitting to wanting to be a Jet, but Hall did exactly that when questioned by the British media about his name being involved in potential trade rumors. Hall has handled 50 percent of the Jets’ rush attempts this season and has totaled 501 yards on 83 touches through the team’s first five games. He has yet to find the end zone, but Hall’s 5.3 YPC and and 6.0 yards per touch are both his highest marks since his rookie year, and he’s easily the Jets’ top option based on where things stand right now. Hall is in the final year of his rookie contract, and if the Jets don’t want to re-sign him in the offseason, then trading him to a contender for picks may be the most logical approach. Whether or not the team truly wants to move him at the deadline is anybody’s guess, but the 0-5 Jets should be listening to any deals that come their way between now and the November 4th deadline.</description>

      <title>Jaguars HC Liam Coen said Greg Newsome will have “an opportunity to play” in Week 6 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ce9d-d94a-a79d-cf9d0be70000</link>
      <description>Speaking with the media on Friday, Coen said there’s some crossover between what the Jaguars do defensively and what Newsome did with the Browns that should put Newsome in line to see some snaps. Whether or not he draws the start is to be determined, but it doesn’t sound like the Jaguars will waste too much time getting Newsome on the field in a meaningful capacity, especially after they traded starting corner Tyson Campbell to acquire him.</description>
