      <title>Eagles S Andrew Mukuba (groin) was seen in pads and is “ready to practice in some form today.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0131-db7b-a5dd-a13583db0000</link>
      <description>The Eagles drafted Mukuba in the second round this year. He was competing with Sydney Brown for one of the starting safety roles when he suffered a shoulder injury in late July. He later picked up a groin injury upon returning. Mukuba is likely slated for a backup role early in the year, but his draft capital should get him more opportunities to take over as a starter as the year progresses.</description>

      <title>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McLane reports that Eagles OG Landon Dickerson (knee) is “trending toward playing” in Week 1 against the Cowboys.</title>

      <description>Dickerson recently underwent surgery to address a meniscus injury. It appears as though his rehab has gone well. The three-time-defending Pro Bowl blocker should play a pivotal role as the Eagles likely attempt to ground-and-pound their way to victory in the season opener against the Cowboys on Thursday..</description>

      <title>The Bengals are utilizing RB Chase Brown “more split out wide versus linebackers” and have “restructured the run game specifically around his skill set.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-01b7-dbe3-a9bb-31f7a17b0000</link>
      <description>Beat writers suggesting that a starting running back could line up as a receiver more often is a common theme among summer puff pieces. We should not fully expect Brown to suddenly be treated as a part-time wide receiver pre-snap, but it’s reasonable to believe that he could see increased passing game usage this season. Over the last three years, the Bengals have led the league in neutral game passing rates twice. Reports continue to suggest Brown will maintain a featured role while receiving RB Samaje Perine takes on a “lesser version” of his prior third-down role. The Bengals’ ground game restructure also bodes positively for his rushing efficiency. Brown profiles as a high-upside RB1.</description>

      <title>Cowboys CB Trevon Diggs (knee) said he is “unsure” of his availability for Week 1 but will play “no later than Week 4.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-01f4-db7b-a5dd-a1f4dd470000</link>
      <description>That is a very wide range of potential outcomes, Mr. Diggs. For what it’s worth, the Cowboys’ cornerback is currently practicing in full. It’s anyone’s guess as to whether he will be cleared to play four days from now. The Cowboys’ defense sure could use reliable coverage defenders, with its pass rush now profiling as a potential liability on the front end.</description>

      <title>Bills DT DeWayne Carter will miss the 2025 season after rupturing his Achilles tendon.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-01d7-db7b-a5dd-a1d706770000</link>
      <description>Carter missed multiple games with a wrist injury during his 2024 rookie season. He totaled 10 tackles and eight quarterback pressures while active. It’s a brutal blow for the former third-round pick.</description>

      <title>A.J. Brown (hamstring) said he will play in the Eagles’ Thursday Night Football game against the Cowboys in Week 1.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0227-db7b-a5dd-a2278f450000</link>
      <description>The Eagles handled Brown’s hamstring rehab conservatively, and he’s been able to continue practicing without issue since last Wednesday. Barring a setback, Brown can be started as a safe WR1 against a Cowboys defense that will struggle to rush the passer. If the Cowboys’ offense can keep things competitive, Brown could have quite the busy night.</description>

      <title>Panthers DE Derrick Brown “has continued to impress this summer and should be a force” in his return from last year’s season-ending knee injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0210-db7b-a5dd-a214dca80000</link>
      <description>Brown was sidelined for the entirety of the 2024 season after undergoing surgery to repair a meniscus tear that he suffered in Week 1. Brown has been a “high-impact player” for years, notably setting the defensive linemen record for tackles in a single season (103) in 2023. The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports, “judging by conversations with those around him this season, it doesn’t sound like there’s any dropoff in sight.” Brown was held out of preseason play due to a separaterib/obliqueissue, but there are no indications that Brown’s Week 1 availability is in question. The Panthers’ defensive leader will have a busy day, attempting to contain the Jaguars’ three-deep rushing attack.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Nate Taylor reports Trent McDuffie “is not expected to agree on a multiyear contract extension” with the Chiefs before the start of the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0540-de13-afdd-47cb9fa20000</link>
      <description>McDuffie had his fifth-year option picked up by the team earlier this offseason and is now under contract through the 2026 season. McDuffie earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2023 and was a second-team All-Pro in 2024 after tallying two interceptions and 13 pass breakups while earning a PFF coverage grade of 80.6. McDuffie will earn a base salary just north of $2.613 million this season, with that number jumping to $13.632 million next season. It wouldn’t be surprising if a new deal was reached before the start of the 2026 campaign if McDuffie continues to perform at the high level we’ve seen over the last two seasons.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Trevon Diggs’ status for Week 1 is “up in the air.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0553-d332-a1fd-97770cab0000</link>
      <description>Diggs is still working his way back from a season-ending knee injury, and while he avoided the PUP list to start the season, Rapoport said after speaking to team reporters that some have suggested his return will be “no later than Week 4.” It’s an odd way to phrase things, but it doesn’t sound like there’s much optimism that Diggs will be ready in time for Thursday night when the Cowboys visit the Eagles to kick off the season. That said, a return before Week 4 would make some sense, given that Diggs would have been forced to miss the first four weeks had he opened the season on the PUP list. With official practice reports set to be released this week, we’ll gain a better sense of Diggs’ availability once we see how the team lists his participation.</description>
