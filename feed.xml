      <title>S Shilo Sanders visited the 49ers on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7872-d93f-ad9d-7af7a3c00000</link>
      <description>Deion’s other son played for the Buccaneers in training camp and was waived well ahead of final cuts. This is the first time we’ve seen him on the league’s transaction wire since.</description>

      <title>Seahawks RB Zach Charbonnet (foot) was an estimated full participant in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-78e8-d6a5-adff-feeddbed0000</link>
      <description>The Seahawks held a walk-through practice, but Charbonnet was estimated as a full participant for the second straight day. He missed the Seahawks’ Week 3 win over the Saints, but is now back on track to play Thursday against the Cardinals. Kenneth Walker scored twice but averaged an inefficient 2.4 yards per carry on Sunday without Charbonnet. Look for Charbonnet to be involved again in Week 4. The other backfield injury concern is fullback Robbie Ouzts (ankle), who was an estimated non-participant on back-to-back days.</description>

      <title>Seahawks TE Elijah Arroyo (groin) was an estimated limited participant in Tuesday’s walk-through practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-78f1-dfde-a1bd-7efd34910000</link>
      <description>Arroyo was an estimated limited participant in both Monday and Tuesday’s practice reports. The rookie has four receptions so far this season, splitting tight end looks with AJ Barner. There is no indication this is an injury that will cost Arroyo time, but Barner will get a slight boost in opportunity should Arroyo miss Thursday’s Week 4 game against the Cardinals.</description>

      <title>Seahawks CB Devon Witherspoon (knee) was an estimated limited participant in Tuesday’s walk-through practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-78ff-d1b3-a5dd-79ffa9500000</link>
      <description>Rookie safety Nick Emmanwori (ankle) and DB Julian Love (hamstring) were also listed as limited. None of the trio practiced last week, so it is notable that they were estimated limited participants both Monday and Tuesday. The boost to the secondary was not needed in a blowout victory against the Saints in Week 3, but Witherspoon, Emmanwori, and Love returning for Week 4 against the Cardinals will help the defense in a rivalry game.</description>

      <title>Cardinals CB Will Johnson (groin) did not participate in Tuesday’s walk-through practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-790a-d1b3-a5dd-797b58570000</link>
      <description>Johnson did not practice last week and missed the Cardinals’ Week 3 game against the 49ers. The rookie got off to a good start the first two weeks of the season, but a groin injury is now causing him to miss time. He was estimated as a non-participant for both Monday and Tuesday, so it is unlikely we see him on Thursday against the Seahawks.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Terry McLaurin (quad) is “very much in doubt” for Week 4 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7bbf-dca3-a9fb-7fbfafbc0000</link>
      <description>McLaurin sitting for Week 4, according to Rapoport, would “not be a surprise” after he left Sunday’s win over the Raiders with the quad issue. McLaurin is seeking medical opinions about the injury, which could mean he’s facing an extended period on the sideline. If he misses Week 4, look for Zach Ertz and Deebo Samuel to see an uptick in targets. Luke McCaffrey, who had three receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown in Week 3, could be a deep league option if McLaurin is sidelined. McLaurin has been an iron man of sorts, starting 72 consecutive games for Washington.</description>

      <title>Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon said he’s “fully confident” in RB Trey Benson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7bd5-d6e9-af9d-fbd543280000</link>
      <description>“I’m fully confident in Trey, I really am,” Gannon told reporters when asked about the Arizona backfield following James Conner’s season-ending ankle injury. “I think the more he plays, the more comfortable you see him getting and the better he’s going to be.” Kyler Murray, meanwhile, said he has the “ultimate confidence” in Benson as the Cardinals’ top back. Benson, who’s impressed with a limited workload so far this season, will function as the Cardinals’ lead back for the remainder of the season. Emari Demercado, who had two rushes last week against the Niners, will be the team’s RB2. With enough pass game involvement, Benson could shape up as a top-10 weekly fantasy option, starting with Thursday night’s matchup against a tough Seahawks defense.</description>

      <title>Alec Pierce (concussion) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7be6-deb6-a7fd-7bff6cd30000</link>
      <description>Pierce remains in the league’s concussion protocol after sustaining a brain injury in Week 3 against the Titans. He caught four balls for 67 yards in that game, operating as Daniel Jones’ primary downfield threat. If he’s sidelined for Week 4 against the Rams, look for AD Mitchell to see a major increase in snaps and pass routes.</description>

      <title>Chris Godwin (ankle) was seen participating at Bucs practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7c65-deb6-a7fd-7fff73e60000</link>
      <description>Fox Sports’ Greg Auman said Godwin could return as soon as Sunday against the Eagles. This comes after an ESPN report in which Adam Schefter said there was a “strong chance” Godwin makes his return to game action in Week 4. The Bucs will need Godwin with Mike Evans sidelined for the next 3-4 weeks following a hamstring injury in Week 3 against the Jets. While Godwin might not see a full complement of snaps and routes against the Eagles, he should be in fantasy lineups if he suits up.</description>

      <title>Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said Michael Penix will start Week 4 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7c71-deb6-a7fd-7fff91a10000</link>
      <description>Morris said the team wasn’t close to benching Penix following the team’s Week 3 meltdown against the Panthers. Penix against Carolina completed 18-of-36 passes for 172 yards and two interceptions. Penix was the week’s second most inaccurate quarterback, trailing only Trevor Lawrence. Kirk Cousins came in last week for fourth quarter mop-up duty, but appears far from seizing the starting gig from Penix, who has one touchdown pass over the season’s first three games.</description>
