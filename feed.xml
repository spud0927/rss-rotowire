      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports QB Aaron Rodgers isn’t expected to return to the Steelers next season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ccd1-d56e-afff-eef9cb4c0000</link>
      <description>While Rodgers’ future in the NFL remains uncertain, it’s become clear he’s unlikely to continue quarterbacking the Steelers next season. Rapoport’s report that the 42-year-old signal caller isn’t expected to return to Pittsburgh comes on the heels of Steelers owner Art Rooney II saying as much at his press conference earlier this week. Rooney made it clear that Rodgers joined the Steelers last year to play for Mike Tomlin, who stepped down immediately following the team’s loss in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Without Tomlin, there’s almost no chance of the Rodgers-Steelers partnership continuing. If Rodgers does ultimately decide to keep playing, there should be plenty of openings this offseason with the draft and free agency light on starting options. He’s still one final stop in Minnesota away from completing the Full Favre, though he engaged in discussions with the Vikings last offseason.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports Bills DT Ed Oliver (biceps) is less than 100 percent and will play limited snaps in the Divisional Round against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cd03-d35e-a1bf-cdc3fd0b0000</link>
      <description>The Bills activated Oliver along with WR Curtis Samuel (elbow, neck) from injured reserve earlier this week. While Oliver has missed all but three games this year, he recorded a sack in all three of those contests. Even in limited snaps, he should provide run-stuffing ability and pass rush juice while he’s out there.</description>

      <title>Eagles interviewed former Giants interim HC Mike Kafka for their vacant offensive coordinator position.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cd29-dc7a-af9b-cfbf7a9d0000</link>
      <description>The team completed the interview Saturday following the parting of ways with former offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo, who was fired earlier in the week. The change comes in the wake of a 6.9 points per game decrease in scoring compared to their Super Bowl-winning season in 2024, meaning quarterback Jalen Hurts will operate with a sixth offensive coordinator in his seventh professional season when the new league year begins.</description>

      <title>Bills RB Ty Johnson (ankle) is inactive for the Divisional Round against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cd57-dc7a-af9b-cfffb8b10000</link>
      <description>Johnson came into the weekend listed as questionable after a single limited session in practice this week, ultimately deemed inactive for the second consecutive playoff contest. Expect Ray Davis to once again fill in as the primary change of pace and clear passing situation back, as he did in the Wild Card win over the Jaguars. Also inactive for the Bills are LB Terrel Bernard, S Jordan Poyer, CB Maxwell Hairston, OT Tylan Grable, DT Phidarian Mathis, and TE Keleki Latu.</description>

      <title>Broncos declared QB Sam Ehlinger, TE Caleb Lohner, WR Elijah Moore, ILB Karene Reid, CB Reese Taylor, OLB Que Robinson, and DL Sai’Vion Jones inactive for the Divisional Round against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cd8f-d968-a19b-ddff76060000</link>
      <description>The Broncos begin their path to the Super Bowl as one of the healthier teams in the league after their Wild Card bye as the No. 1 seed in the AFC, enough so that they appear to have elevated two practice squad members, Elijah Moore and Caleb Lohner, to receive a small roster bonus as thanks for their time on the practice squad this season. The home-favorite Broncos face a difficult challenge against the Josh Allen-led Bills as they aim to avoid the same postseason outcome as in 2024 when the Bills bounced the Broncos in a blowout loss.</description>

      <title>Chargers will interview former Giants HC Brian Daboll for their vacant offensive coordinator position.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cd9e-dc7a-af9b-cfbfeb670000</link>
      <description>Daboll has drawn significant interest for numerous vacant offensive coordinator positions around the league in recent weeks and could land on his feet with a change of scenery after a turbulent head coaching stint with the Giants. He also interviewed with the Titans on Friday for their vacant head coaching position.</description>

      <title>Giants signed former Ravens HC John Harbaugh to a five-year contract to be their next head coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cda1-d56e-afff-efe9a71e0000</link>
      <description>And... it’s done. After numerous delays amidst contract minutiae, the two sides have agreed on a five-year contract to make Harbaugh the team’s next head coach. The former Ravens head coach was one of the longest tenured head coaches in the league before being fired last week, quickly landing on his feet with one of the more desirable head coaching vacancies in the league. He’ll be tasked with turning around a franchise that has had little success in the post-Eli era.</description>

      <title>Dorian Williams is out for the game after a neck injury after the opening kickoff of the AFC Division Round against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cde2-d35e-a1bf-cde2b4330000</link>
      <description>He was able to walk off the field on his own but was then carted to the locker room. Williams tackled Marvin Mims on the opening kickoff, and their helmets collided. Williams’ arms went limp, and he was down on the turf for an extended period of time. With Terrell Bernard (ankle) inactive for this game, the Bills will be without key linebacker depth with Williams missing the rest of this game.</description>

      <title>Pat Bryant has been ruled out for the remainder of the AFC Divisional Round against the Bills with a concussion.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cdf6-d56e-afff-effe5c8d0000</link>
      <description>Bryant had three catches for 32 yards on the first drive and looked set to be a huge part of this offensive gameplan. However, he suffered a concussion when his helmet hit the ground after his final catch. Lil’Jordan Humphrey took his place but dropped a touchdown catch on the first drive.</description>

      <title>Connor McGovern was taken to the locker room with a head injury in the AFC Divisional Round against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ce10-dc7a-af9b-cfbff8170000</link>
      <description>McGovern dove to try to recover a fumble by James Cook and was hit hard in the back of his head. He went into the medical tent and then walked into the locker room. Alec Anderson is replacing him, but playing on the road in Denver is a rough environment for a backup center.</description>
