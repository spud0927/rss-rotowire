      <title>Texans signed RB Jawhar Jordan to their active roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-291b-d005-a9bf-f93fbcef0000</link>
      <description>It’s possible he had outside interest. It’s also possible that the Texans got worse news than expected on the health of Woody Marks (ankle) or Nick Chubb (ribs) — if Marks doesn’t make it to Sunday healthy, Jordan would be a halfway interesting RB3 play against what certainly appears to be a dead-on-arrival Raiders squad.</description>

      <title>Titans placed S Kevin Winston Jr. (hamstring) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-291e-d8cf-affb-bd3e2c150000</link>
      <description>He’s joined there by fellow safeties Mike Brown (ankle) and Xavier Woods (hamstring) as the Titans signed Erick Hallett and Sanoussi Kane off the Lions and Ravens practice squads. It is certainly End Of Season Hours in Tennessee. 2025 third-round pick Winston finishes his rookie season with a 89.4 PFF run defense grade, but just a 43.4 PFF coverage grade. It was a land of contrasts. He’ll probably be the favorite to start next to Amani Hooker next season if he’s healthy.</description>

      <title>Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Josh Jacobs (knee) wouldn’t have practiced Tuesday if the Packers held a practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2924-d1bc-a3fb-ad241d420000</link>
      <description>Jacobs, who played last week on a pitch count, aggravated his knee injury against the Broncos in Week 15’s loss. “He’s battling through,” LaFleur told reporters. “This guy is as tough as they come. So I’ll never count him out of the fight, I’ll tell you that.” We’d expect another week of Jacobs playing through the injury on Saturday in a huge game against the Bears for the top of the NFC North. Emanuel Wilson would certainly be a playable fantasy football starter in Week 16 if it came to that.</description>

      <title>Giants waived K Younghoe Koo.</title>

      <title>Giants claimed LB Caleb Murphy off waivers from the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-292f-d1bc-a3fb-ad2f0b860000</link>
      <description>The Giants have had a hole at linebacker all season next to Bobby Okereke, so Murphy might get a look down the stretch. He could be IDP viable as well, given that these are the 2025 New York Giants he’s playing with.</description>

      <title>Bengals claimed WR Ke’Shawn Williams off waivers from the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2937-d8cf-affb-bd3f19870000</link>
      <description>Williams has only played nine offensive snaps this year and was signed as a UDFA out of Indiana earlier this offseason. He’ll work on special teams for the Bengals and likely has no fantasy value barring further injuries to the Cincinnati wideout corps.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2937-d8cf-affb-bd3f19870000</guid>

      <title>Titans claimed G Garrett Dellinger off waivers from the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-293a-d8cf-affb-bd3a1fc30000</link>
      <description>He’ll join an interior line room that has watched Kevin Zeitler and Lloyd Cushenberry miss games over the past month. Dellinger was a seventh-rounder in the 2025 Draft by the Ravens. He might get a look down the stretch as the Titans wrap up the season.</description>

      <title>Bills signed K Michael Badgley to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-293c-d1bc-a3fb-ad3c2d500000</link>
      <description>With Matt Prater injured and unlikely to go this week, Badgley will be a solid streamer kicker in Week 16 as Buffalo takes on the Browns.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-293c-d1bc-a3fb-ad3c2d500000</guid>

      <title>Bears WR Rome Odunze (foot) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-294f-d005-a9bf-f97fc0ad0000</link>
      <description>It’s a walk-thru and an estimated report today, but this isn’t surprising after Ben Johnson’s ominous words for Odunze’s situation on Monday. Odunze is closer to doubtful than questionable based on Johnson saying the Bears may “need to protect him from himself” with this injury after he re-aggravated it right before game time in Week 15.</description>

      <title>Bears WR Luther Burden (ankle) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2951-d005-a9bf-f975ce330000</link>
      <description>After Ben Johnson called him day-to-day coming out of the Bears’ Week 15 game, where he left in the third quarter, Burden did not exactly assuage concerns he’d miss Saturday’s game with this DNP. Burden still has time to turn it around, and this was only an estimation, but it’s not an auspicious start to the week.</description>
