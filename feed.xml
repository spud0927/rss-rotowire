      <title>Eagles RT Lane Johnson (foot) did not practice in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-29a0-d005-a9bf-f9b4b1e80000</link>
      <description>In addition to Johnson, LG Landon Dickerson (calf) also was listed as DNP. Dickerson was at least able to play in Week 15, meaning the designation could just be out of precaution for Tuesday’s walkthrough ahead of a Saturday game. As for Johnson, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reportedlast week he was going to practice this week, but he remains out to start Week 16. Johnson has a few more days to practice before the Eagles play the Commanders on Saturday.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Daniel Oyefusi reports Browns LB Devin Bush was found not guilty of assault and harassment charges stemming from a May incident.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-29ca-d8cf-affb-bdeabb5b0000</link>
      <description>Bush was arrested in May on charges of simple assault and harassment. The 27-year-old linebacker has been available for the Browns this season with his trial set for December, snagging two interceptions and making 93 combined tackles in 14 games so far. Oyefusi reports that court documents show Bush was found not guilty of the simple assault and harassment chargers on Tuesday. Bush is now clear to play the rest of the season.</description>

      <title>Notre Dame RB Jeremiyah Love has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-29cf-d005-a9bf-f9ffaf8b0000</link>
      <description>Love is one of the nations’ top running back prospects, finishing his junior year at Notre Dame with 199 carries for 1,372 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns, adding 27 receptions for 280 yards and three touchdowns. He finished as a finalist for the Heisman Trophy award and won the Doak Walker award for the top running back in college football. Teams in the first round of the draft will already be circling Love’s name at the top of their running back big boards; he is certainly a candidate to go in the top 10 picks, similar to Ashton Jeanty in 2025.</description>

      <title>Rams WR Davante Adams (hamstring) did not practice in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2a17-d005-a9bf-fa37ce800000</link>
      <description>As expected, Adams was listed with a DNP for the Rams’ Tuesday walkthrough. Sean McVay did not rule Adams out for Thursday’s game against the Seahawks and said he could be a game-time decision. Adams re-aggravated his hamstring injury in Week 15 and getting healthy on a short week will be difficult. Colby Parkinson emerges as a red zone target for the Rams if Adams is out for Week 16.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dan Duggan believes Giants QB Jaxson Dart “has a target on his back as a runner.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-28e6-d8cf-affb-bceeb9880000</link>
      <description>Duggan pointed to comments from Commanders head coach Dan Quinn ahead of Washington’s Week 15 game against Dart and the Giants as evidence that New York opponents are targeting Dart based on his willingness to take big hits, even to the head. “The quarterback is a very competitive dual-threat guy. He will try to run the ball like a running back,” Quinn told his defense last week. “He will try to run you over. He will try to stiff-arm. He doesn’t really run out of bounds. He doesn’t slide a whole bunch. We can get the ball off of him.” Dart took yet another shot to the head in the Giants’ Week 15 loss to the Commanders and was checked for a concussion before re-entering the ballgame. Dart has missed time with brain injuries this season and continues to lower his head as a rusher in the open field. It’s something he’ll need to change if he wants to have a long NFL career.</description>

      <title>Jets signed TE Jeremy Ruckert to a two-year contract extension worth $10 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2cb3-d77b-adfb-eeb3ad890000</link>
      <description>The new deal includes a maximum of $11 over the 2026 and 2027 seasons. Ruckert, drafted by the Jets in 2022, has 55 receptions on 75 targets over four NFL seasons, including 20 catches for 163 yards and a touchdown in 2025. Ruckert has seen some more involvement in the Jets offense of late, recording two receptions in each of the past three contests. The team’s commitment to Ruckert could raise questions about how the Jets see TE Mason Taylor, a rookie with 44 receptions for 369 yards and a score this season.</description>

      <title>Dolphins QB Quinn Ewers will start in Week 16.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2d08-d005-a9bf-fd3cb1b20000</link>
      <description>Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel meant it when he said everything was on the table after Miami’s humiliating Monday night loss to the Steelers. Tua Tagovailoa will take a seat in Week 16 — and perhaps beyond — after his dismal play throughout 2025. Tagovailoa ranks 27th out of 33 qualifying quarterbacks in adjusted yards per attempt, 14th in drop back success rate, and 26th in EPA per drop back through Week 15. He has just three TD passes over his past four games in the run-heavy Miami offense. Ewers in the preseason completed 23 of 43 attempts for 273 yards and two touchdowns. He was sacked on nearly half of his pressures. Ewers should be considered a fringe superflex option for Week 16 against a miserable Bengals defense allowing two passing scores per game.</description>

      <title>Tua Tagovailoa was benched in favor of Quinn Ewers for Week 16 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2d0f-d005-a9bf-fd3fcd490000</link>
      <description>The move comes after the Dolphins’ crushing defeat against the Steelers on Monday night. Tagovailoa’s struggles have persisted for the better part of two seasons, and this year he ranks 27th out of 33 qualifying quarterbacks in adjusted yards per attempt, 14th in drop back success rate, and 26th in EPA per drop back. Since losing Tyreek Hill to a season-ending leg injury in September, Tua is one of the least efficient QBs in the league. His contract with Miami doesn’t have a potential out until 2027, meaning the team might have no choice but to pay him $56.4 million in 2026 even if he’s not the starter. There won’t be many teams inquiring about Tua’s services after he was thoroughly exposed in the absence of the game-breaking Hill.</description>

      <title>Dolphins released EDGE Matthew Judon.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2d19-d77b-adfb-ef9bb35f0000</link>
      <description>The Dolphins are moving on from entrenched veterans with their season officially over following Monday night’s blowout loss to the Steelers. The team benched QB Tua Tagovailoa on Wednesday shortly after releasing Judon, who a ten-year veteran pass rusher who has just 9.5 sacks over the past three seasons combined. In Judon’s 13 appearances with the Dolphins, Judon racked up 19 combined tackles, one tackle for loss and three quarterback hits. He did not have a sack over those 13 games. Judon will almost certainly sign with a contending team in need of a rotational pass rusher.</description>

      <title>Falcons WR Drake London (knee) practiced Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2d39-d8cf-affb-bd3b1fb60000</link>
      <description>It’s a positive sign for London’s Week 16 availability against the Cardinals, though head coach Raheem Morris cautioned against assuming London will play Sunday. “Looking forward to seeing how much he’ll be able to give us this week,” Morris told reporters Wednesday. London has bee sidelined with a knee injury since the middle of November. The Falcons, eliminated from postseason contention, don’t have much reason to rush back (or play) their star receiver in the season’s final weeks. If London suits up in Week 16, he will be an elite option against an Arizona secondary that has been shredded of late. London’s return would put something of a damper on Kyle Pitts’ emergence and would make David Sills V unplayable in most formats.</description>
