      <title>Jordan Schultz reports the Dolphins “have had trade talks with teams regarding” S Minkah Fitzpatrick.</title>

      <description>Fitzpatrick returned to Miami in 2025 as part of the deal that sent Jalen Ramsey to Pittsburgh. He appeared in 14 games, totaling six pass breakups and one interception. Fitzpatrick also added one sack and two fumble recoveries. The Dolphins have already made the decision to release Tyreek Hill and Bradley Chubb to save cap space. They will almost certainly take a deal to move Fitzpatrick if it gives them more ammunition in the draft. This is shaping up to be a true reset season for Miami.</description>

      <title>Titans offensive coordinator Brian Daboll said Cam Ward was a “big factor” in taking the Titans’ offensive coordinator job.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7275-d990-a1de-7e7fd9130000</link>
      <description>Daboll praised both Ward’s athleticism and accuracy when discussing the second-year passer. Ward occasionally flashed big-play potential as a rookie, but he spent most of his debut campaign missing passes and taking sacks. Defenses took him down behind the line of scrimmage a league-high 55 times. He completed just shy of 60 percent of his passes. Daboll has had success with young quarterbacks in the past. He coaxed a playoff berth out of Daniel Jones in 2022 and oversaw a handful of solid performances from Jaxson Dart in 2025 before the Giants canned him. Daboll has a tall order ahead of him, but quarterback has become a late-bloomer position in recent years, with Caleb Williams serving as the poster child for a post-rookie rebound. Titans fans will be hoping for a similar turnaround from Ward.</description>

      <title>Rams re-signed OT David Quessenberry to a one-year contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7287-d629-a1bc-f29f51660000</link>
      <description>Quessenberry signed a one-year deal with the Rams last offseason to fill a backup role. He appeared in 13 regular season games, seeing most of his work on special teams. He will take on a similar role in 2026.</description>

      <title>49ers re-signed OT Nick Zakelj to a one-year contract.</title>

      <description>Zakelj spent the 2025 season on San Francisco’s practice squad. He was called up for three games, seeing a handful of snaps on offense and special teams. Zakelj will be battling for a roster spot this summer.</description>

      <title>Browns RG Wyatt Teller announced he will be leaving the team in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-72dd-d89c-a1be-ffdfe82a0000</link>
      <description>Teller made a heartfelt post to the city of Cleveland and its fans on social media to say his goodbyes. All five starting offensive linemen for the Browns are set to hit free agency, and now at least one of them will not be back. At 31 years old, the three-time Pro Bowl guard should have plenty of suitors in free agency.</description>

      <title>Seahawks WR Rashid Shaheed said he “would love to come back” to the Seahawks next season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7309-d629-a1bc-f31d28540000</link>
      <description>Shaheed is set to enter free agency this offseason after spending a half-season with the Seahawks. The 27-year-old was traded from the Saints to Seattle at the trade deadline and tallied 15 receptions for 188 yards in nine games for the Seahawks, adding three receptions for 78 yards in the playoffs. He most notably was a return specialist for the team, returning a kick for a touchdown to open the Seahawks’ Divisional Round win over the 49ers. When asked if he would consider a return, Shaheed said, “I kind of want to run it back. We just won the Super Bowl, so, you know, why not?” Though his offensive role was minimalized in Seattle’s offense, Shaheed has value as deep threat and return specialist. Expect him to generate much interest during free agency in March.</description>

      <title>CBS Sports’ Matt Zenitz reports the Broncos are expected to hire Bills quarterbacks coach Ronald Curry as their wide receivers coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7377-d629-a1bc-f37f6a370000</link>
      <description>Curry also interviewed for the Broncos’ offensive coordinator vacancy and now lands in Denver as the wide receivers coach. He spent the past two seasons as the Bills’ quarterbacks coach, working with Josh Allen and company under Joe Brady. Curry previously worked as an offensive assistant under Sean Payton with the Saints earlier in his career, now returning to Payton’s staff to work with Courtland Sutton, Pat Bryant, and more.</description>

      <title>Eagles RT Lane Johnson announced he will return for a 14th NFL season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-72e5-d042-afbc-7ff714a20000</link>
      <description>Johnson told The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McLane the news on Thursday morning. The potential Hall of Famer missed the second half of the 2025 season with a Lisfranc injury, though it shouldn’t affect him for the upcoming season. The 2026 season will mark his first without offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, who stepped down from the role at the end of the year. With Philly’s 2025 season going down as a bit of a dud, 2026 might be a one last ride situation for the veteran tackle. The hope is that a change at offensive coordinator revives the team’s explosive plays on the ground and through the air.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Matt Barrows believes the “stars could be aligning” for the 49ers to trade QB Mac Jones.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7738-d89c-a1be-fffff4a60000</link>
      <description>Jones “didn’t just look like a starter in 2025 but someone who could lead an imperfect team.” Per Barrows, Quarterback-needy teams could be hoping that Jones becomes the next “Shanahan reclamation project” after watching Sam Darnold lead the Vikings to a 14-3 record in 2024 and the Seahawks to a Super Bowl victory in 2025. Darnold spent the 2023 season as a 49ers backup. The incoming rookie quarterback class is currently viewed as a thin group, which could spur teams to pursue Jones via a trade rather than rolling the dice on a questionable prospect. Barrows notes that the Dolphins, Cardinals and Vikings “are running Shanahan’s offense or something similar,” and views all three as potentially interested parties.</description>

      <title>Bears promoted senior director of player personnel Jeff King to assistant general manager.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-776e-d042-afbc-7ffe66920000</link>
      <description>King replaces former Bears assistant general manager and new Falcons general manager Ian Cunningham. Cunningham held his prior role for four seasons. King joined the NFL’s administrative ranks as a Bears scouting intern in 2015, following an eight-year playing career. He served as a pro scout from 2016-2018 before becoming the assistant director of pro scouting in 2019. He became the director of pro scouting in 2021, the co-director of player personnel in 2022 and was promoted to his prior role in 2024.</description>
