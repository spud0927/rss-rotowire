      <title>Terry McLaurin caught 7-of-14 targets for 96 yards and a touchdown in the Commanders’ Week 13 loss to the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-d876-db57-afda-de7666b40000</link>
      <description>McLaurin was largely confined to key downs in the first half in his first full game since Week 2, but had his number called at greater frequency after the break as the Commanders went into desperation mode in an attempt to end their six-game skid. He would score from 30 yards out in overtime only to see it called by for offensive holding, but made good on the touchdown later on the drive on fourth down from three yards out. McLaurin reminded fantasy managers of his weekly upside ahead of a potential Jayden Daniels return in Week 14.</description>

      <title>Deebo Samuel caught 5-of-7 targets for 64 yards in the Commanders’ Week 13 loss to the Broncos, losing three yards on two carries.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-d87a-d6c4-abfb-de7b63590000</link>
      <description>Samuel took a backseat to tight end Zach Ertz and alpha wide receiver Terry McLaurin in what was the first full game from McLaurin since Week 2, seeing just seven looks to the 14 of McLaurin and the 13 of Ertz. That gives fantasy managers reason for concern considering quarterback Marcus Mariota set a career high with 50 pass attempts i the overtime affair, particularly with Jayden Daniels appearing ready to return to the active roster in Week 14. Samuel’s days of consistent fantasy production could be behind him in 2025.</description>

      <title>Treylon Burks caught 1-of-4 targets for a five-yard touchdown in the Commanders’ Week 13 loss to the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-d87c-db57-afda-de7ece7a0000</link>
      <description>Burks showed a glimpse at what made him a first-round pick for the Titans in the 2022 draft as he elevated over a defender for a one-handed touchdown in the third quarter. Unfortunately for him, that would go down as his only reception of the evening with the return of Terry McLaurin. He does not hold any fantasy value while playing behind McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, and Jaylin Lane.</description>

      <title>Jason Myers converted all four of his field goal attempts and made both of his extra point attempts in the Seahawks’ Week 13 win against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-d9f6-d90e-a9da-dfffa5ae0000</link>
      <description>Myers went Goblin Mode for fantasy managers, scoring around 20 fantasy points depending on your league’s scoring. Myers has been solid in 2025, making 28 of his 33 field goal tries. The Seahawks lead the NFL with 2.8 field goal attempts per game through Week 13. Myers is an every-week starter in 12-team leagues for the front-running Hawks.</description>

      <title>Will Reichard did not attempts a field goal or extra point in the Vikings’ Week 13 loss against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-d9fe-db57-afda-dffec74f0000</link>
      <description>Reichard is all but useless for fantasy purposes, attached to a lifeless Minnesota offense that rarely produces the neutral and positive game script that creates field goal opportunities. Reichard has made 21 of 23 field goal tries this season. The Vikings, meanwhile, average just 1.8 field goal attempts per game.</description>

      <title>Lions HC Dan Campbell said he has “no indication” about whether or not Frank Ragnow will attempt to return in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-da1b-db57-afda-de3b76b00000</link>
      <description>Ragnow’s attempt at a comeback was dashed when the veteran center failed his physical due to a Grade 3 hamstring injury. Ragnow was hoping to un-retire and help the Lions make a playoff push over the final month of the season, but given the nature of his injury and the amount of rehab he would need in order to play, a return didn’t make much sense. Still only 29 years old, Ragnow’s decision to walk away from the game was due to the myriad of injuries he has suffered in his career. If he feels physically up to it after a year away, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Ragnow attempt another return for the 2026 season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports a source familiar with the situation said Sauce Garder will likely miss “a few weeks” due to his calf injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-da96-db57-afda-deb658d90000</link>
      <description>Gardner is undergoing additional tests to determine the exact severity of the injury, but as Fowler notes, Gardner seems to have avoided a major injury. We’ll likely get a clearer timeline on Gardner’s impending absence in the next 24 hours or so, but it sounds like he’ll be a lock to miss Week 14’s game against the Jaguars, and perhaps Week 15’s game against the Seahawks. In three games with the Colts this season, Gardner has totaled 13 tackles and two pass breakups while holding opposing receivers to 38 yards on 10 targets.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Sauce Gardner is considered week-to-week after an MRI revealed he suffered a calf strain in Week 13’s loss to the Texans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-dab9-db57-afda-debb922e0000</link>
      <description>It’s the best Gardner and the Colts could have hoped for after the initial injury appeared to be much worse on the field. Gardner will miss a few weeks with what is officially being diagnosed as a strained calf, but according to Rapoport, the Colts hope to have him back before the end of the regular season. Barring an unexpected turn of events, Gardner should avoid a stint on injured reserve. Mekhi Blackmon is listed behind him on the depth chart and should step in to replace Gardner during his absence.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Steelers LB Patrick Queen is believed to have suffered a lower back bruise in Week 13’s loss to the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-dac1-d90e-a9da-dfcf60400000</link>
      <description>It’s quite a shift from the hip injury this was initially classified as, but Queen is undergoing further tests to determine the specifics of his injury. According to Rapoport, the Steelers hope Queen’s injury isn’t something long-term, but it sounds like he could be sidelined for at least one game. Queen and the Steelers have a pivotal Week 14 matchup against the Ravens on tap as they battle for supremacy in the down bad AFC North. If he’s unable to go, Malik Harrison would be the next man up on the depth chart.</description>

      <title>Patriots added C Garrett Bradbury (illness) to the injury report ahead of Week 13’s game against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-dacf-d90e-a9da-dfcf51ec0000</link>
      <description>Bradbury is now considered questionable for Monday night’s tilt with the Giants. With the Patriots already down rookie offensive tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson, the team can ill-afford to lose a third starter along the line. The good news is that players listed with illnesses tend to play through those things more often than not. In the event he can’t go, however, Ben Brown would be next in line to fill his spot.</description>
