      <title>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said Omarion Hampton (ankle) will not have his window to return opened until after the Chargers’ Week 12 bye week.</title>

      <description>This has been the tenor of most updates on Hampton, who was placed on IR after Week 5, as he was still spotted in a walking boot after Thursday’s win over the Vikings. Kimani Vidal will continue to be the main back to roster for the Chargers at the moment, though it’s hard to see Hampton not getting the majority of the reps whenever he eventually is activated off injured reserve.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Cardinals QB Kyler Murray (foot) will not play in Week 9 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4bfc-d713-ad9e-6ffce74a0000</link>
      <description>The team was reportedly set to see how the veteran signal caller responded to a pre-game workout, but it now appears as if he will miss a third straight game. Murray’s next chance to take the field will come in Week 10 against the division rival Seahawks, which will mark over a calendar month since he sustained the foot injury when you include the team’s Week 8 bye.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports Cowboys have had talks with Bengals on DE Trey Hendrickson and LB Logan Wilson and Dolphins on OLB Bradley Chubb.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4c1a-d1e7-a1fa-5efa35300000</link>
      <description>The Cowboys appear intent on adding pass rush help after trading away Micah Parsons to the Packers this offseason, with Schultz going so far as to say, “a deal is getting done somewhere.” it is public knowledge that the Bengals are seeking a first round pick in exchange for Hendrickson, making it slightly more likely the Cowboys eventually land either Wilson or Chubb in the coming hours ahead of Tuesday’s trade deadline. Stay tuned to see how this situation unfolds.</description>

      <title>Cardinals QB Kyler Murray (foot) is inactive for Week 9 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4c1d-d713-ad9e-6c5d481a0000</link>
      <description>The initial plan for Murray was to see how he did in pre-game warmups before deciding how involved he would be against the Cowboys, but that plan reportedly went out the window a couple hours before game time, per ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler. Jacoby Brissett will draw the start under center for the third consecutive game against the Cowboys. Also inactive for the Cardinals are CB Elijah Jones, LB Xavier Thomas, OL Demontrey Jacobs, OL Josh Fryar, and DL Bilal Nichols.</description>

      <title>Cowboys DT Mazi Smith is inactive for Week 9 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4c20-d45b-affe-5db6ec820000</link>
      <description>Smith being a healthy inactive seems to indicate the team is including him in offers for help at pass rusher in the coming hours, while the Dallas secondary continues to suffer through a multitude of injuries. Blue’s status as a game-day inactive is interesting considering Miles Sanders remains on injured reserve, leaving Malik Davis to serve as the primary change of pace option behind Javonte Williams. Also inactive for the Cowboys are S Donovan Wilson, S Alijah Clark, OT Ajani Cornelius, RB Jaydon Blue, OL Hakeem Adeniji, and WR Jonathan Mingo.</description>

      <title>NFL suspended Commanders LB Frankie Luvu for one game “for repeated violations of playing rules.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4c4a-d45b-affe-5ddea17f0000</link>
      <description>Luvu committed a hip-drop tackle in the first quarter of the team’s Week 9 contest against the Seahawks, his third such infraction of the season. He was fined for the previous two cases, once in Week 4 and again in Week 8, this time drawing the one-game suspension by the league’s disciplinary office. He will serve his suspension in Week 10 when the Commanders host the Lions before being eligible to return against the Dolphins in Week 11.</description>

      <title>Titans traded LB Dre’Mont Jones to the Ravens for a conditional fifth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4c4d-d673-a39e-ecddbe890000</link>
      <description>The fifth-round pick could become a fourth. Jones has gone on a torrid stretch in recent weeks, amassing 4.5 sacks in his previous four games, and provides the Ravens with a veteran pass rush presence as they make a late-season push towards the postseason.</description>

      <title>Broncos WR Marvin Mims (concussion) was listed as a non-participant on Monday’s estimated practice report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4cd9-d45b-affe-5ddfb2a00000</link>
      <description>Monday’s practice report was an estimation but Mims’ status as a “DNP” does not bode well for his status for the team’s Week 10 matchup against the Raiders on a short week. Mims was concussed in Week 8, meaning Thursday night’s game will be 11 days since suffering the injury. He will need to get on the field in some fashion this week to clear the league’s concussion protocol and play in just three days.</description>

      <title>Broncos CB Riley Moss and S Brandon Jones were listed at “DNP” on Monday’s estimated injury report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4cdc-d1e7-a1fa-5efea7790000</link>
      <description>The team did not hold a practice on Monday ahead of their Week 10 meeting with the Raiders on Thursday Night Football, but the fact two additional members of the secondary appeared on the injury report as non-participants is concerning considering the absence of Pat Surtain. Absences from either could improve the schematic matchups for Jakobi Meyers and Tre Tucker, with tight end Brock Bowers expected to see a good deal of coverage from standout safety Talanoa Hufanga.</description>

      <title>Bills restructured the contract of CB Taron Johnson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4ce0-d45b-affe-5df6fcec0000</link>
      <description>The restructured contract converted $1.75 million of base salary into a signing bonus, generating as much in cap savings as the trade deadline looms. Johnson remains sidelined and without a return timeline but the move could allow the Bills to make a splash before Tuesday’s trade deadline.</description>
