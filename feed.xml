      <title>Chargers TE Will Dissly (knee) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a200-dca3-a9fb-bf99e8ef0000</link>
      <description>Dissly has missed the last two weeks due to a knee issue. He starts out Week 5 practicing, putting him on track to return against the Commanders this week, or against the Dolphins next week. Dissly’s absence has led to an uptick in opportunities for Oronde Gadsden, but a potential Dissly return would decrease those looks for Gadsden.</description>

      <title>Commanders opened the 21-day practice window for OL Sam Cosmi (knee).</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a20f-d95b-addb-ea4fb26a0000</link>
      <description>Cosmi suffered a torn ACL in the Divisional Round last season and began this season on the PUP list. He was a full participant in practice on Wednesday as the Commanders opened his 21-day practice window. Cosmi may not return immediately in Week 5, but should be back in the offensive line rotation within the next three weeks.</description>

      <title>Cardinals RB Michael Carter said he will be starting for the team when speaking to reporters Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a212-deb6-a7fd-f3df6edb0000</link>
      <description>When asked about his journey to signing with the active Cardinals roster, Carter said, “It’s been a lot...go from Pat Tillman one week to starting the next.” The Cardinals’ “Pat Tillman” designation is for the Scout Player of the Week. Carter may have let slip about the Cardinals’ backfield rotation for Week 5, saying he will be “starting the next.” We don’t know how an Emari Demercado - Michael Carter backfield will look like, but Carter certainly believes he will be starting. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said there is a chance we see all three backs, adding Bam Knight into the mix. This is a messy situation for fantasy managers, but it seems Demercado will take passing-down work while Carter has more of the early-down work.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers QB Baker Mayfield (knee/biceps) did not participate in Wednesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a21f-deb6-a7fd-f3dfd5d20000</link>
      <description>Mayfield starts out the week not practicing, a downgrade from last week when he started out the week as a limited participant. He played through a right biceps injury last week, but now has a knee injury added to his practice designation. Mayfield has gritted out injuries before, but having two separate body parts listed on the injury report and starting out the week not practicing is a concerning sign. Head coach Todd Bowles made Wednesday a walkthrough practice, citing lack of healthy players. Full-speed practices from later in the week will tell if Mayfield’s injuries are truly a concern or not for Week 5 against the Seahawks.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers Sterling Shepard (foot) did not participate in Wednesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a226-dca3-a9fb-bfbfb5910000</link>
      <description>Shepard joined a long list of Bucs players not practicing on Wednesday with a foot issue. The veteran has been a small cog in the Bucs’ offense, though with Mike Evans’ hamstring injury keeping him sidelined, Shepard was in line for more snaps. A potential Shepard absence could mean even more opportunities for Emeka Egbuka and Chris Godwin come Sunday against the Seahawks.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers CB Jamel Dean (hip) did not participate in Wednesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a22d-deb6-a7fd-f3ffcacc0000</link>
      <description>Dean left the Bucs’ Week 4 loss to the Eagles with a groin injury that now seems to be more of a hip issue. Also not practicing were CB Benjamin Morrison (hamstring) and DB Christian Izien (quad). If none of the trio can practice the rest of the week, the Bucs’ secondary will look depleted against the Seahawks for Week 5.</description>

      <title>Seahawks S Devon Witherspoon (knee) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a23c-d95b-addb-ea7e7b790000</link>
      <description>Witherspoon played last Thursday after recovering from the knee injury, so his non-participation may be more precautionary than a concern. Practice reports later in the week will tell if he is in jeopardy to miss Week 5 against the Bucs. S Julian Love (hamstring) and DE Demarcus Lawrence (quad) were also both non-participants and the Seahawks defense enters the week a little banged up. On the positive side, S Nick Emmanwori (ankle) was a full participant after missing each of the last three games.</description>

      <title>Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a248-d6e9-af9d-aad8c09a0000</link>
      <description>Bowers has been nursing his knee injury since Week 1 and starts out this week as a limited practice participant. He likely felt soreness between the Raiders’ 4 loss to the Bears and Wednesday, causing him to be limited, compared to last week when he started out as a full practice participant. Bowers’ knee injury still seems to be hampering him as his usage has not been high volume. Fellow TE Michael Mayer (concussion) was a limited participant in practice after missing Week 4. Between Mayer’s potential return and middling usage amid the knee injury, there is reason to be concerned about Bowers’ fantasy outlook, though he is still a fantasy TE1.</description>

      <title>Darren Waller said there will be “a jump” in his snap count in Week 5 against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a4fa-deb6-a7fd-f7ffe6590000</link>
      <description>Waller added the caveat that his reps would jump if that’s what his coaches want. Given that he scored two touchdowns on 16 snaps and the team lost its No. 1 receiver, we’re going to assume that is indeed what Mike McDaniel has planned for Week 5. Waller barely played tight end in his Miami debut, lining up at an inline position on just two of his 12 routes. He could wind up playing a de facto WR2 role for the team with Jaylen Waddle stepping up as the top option through the air. Even on a limited route tree, Waller looks like a viable streaming tight end for Week 5.</description>

      <title>Jets placed RB Braelon Allen (knee) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a530-deb6-a7fd-f7ff07d30000</link>
      <description>Allen’s injury continues to sound worse with every subsequent report. Per ESPN’s Rich Cimini, surgery remains a possibility and it’s “too early to say if it’s season-ending.” Allen is required to miss at least four weeks while on injured reserve, but we expect him to be out much longer than a month. His absence will increase Breece Hall’s role in short-yardage situations, meaning more opportunities for him at the goal line. Allen has six red zone carries this year to Hall’s three. Isaiah Davis is now in line to back up Hall going forward.</description>
