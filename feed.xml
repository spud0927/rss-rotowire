      <title>The Cowboys listed Javonte Williams as the team’s Week 1 starter.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f7ba-d332-a1fd-f7bec5a40000</link>
      <description>The starting job was Williams’ to lose, and indeed, he did not lose it. The praise stops there. Williams will likely handle a flex-worthy workload against the Eagles’ vaunted defense in Week 1, while Miles Sanders and Jaydon Blue rotate in behind him. Unless Williams regains his long-lost burst, he could end up ceding touches quickly as the weeks progress. Sanders does not need to be rostered in 12-team leagues. Buy Blue’s potential ADP dip. The talented receiving back is a good fit for the Cowboys’ expectedly pass-heavy game scripts.</description>

      <title>The NFL suspended free agent DT Isaiah Buggs for the first 10 weeks of the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f789-de13-afdc-f7cb0f2e0000</link>
      <description>The suspension relates to Buggs’ 2024 arrest for burglary and domestic violence charges. The charges were reportedly reduced to misdemeanor criminal trespass as part of a plea agreement. Buggs had previously been sentenced to 60 days of hard labor after being convicted of misdemeanor animal cruelty, but NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reports that those charges were dismissed.</description>

      <title>Panthers head coach Dave Canales said TE Ja’Tavion Sanders “has really improved as a pass catcher.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f7df-de13-afdc-f7df75010000</link>
      <description>The Associated Press’ Steve Reed adds that it “sort of sounds like he will be the primary pass receiver at that position,” but he notes nothing is “etched in stone.” Sanders has decent odds of etching it in stone if his improved play translates to early-season success. Tommy Tremble, Sanders’ primary competition at the position, “hopes” he will be ready for Week 1 but has not yet returned to practice after undergoing back surgery in May. Sanders is a worthwhile dart throw, who can be paired with a reliable, if unexciting, veteran option in drafts.</description>

      <title>Free agent RB Keilan Robinson worked out for the Chargers on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f7e5-dbe3-a9bb-f7f701c30000</link>
      <description>Robinson was joined by free agent RBs, Amar Johnson, Anthony Tyus and Owen Wright. The Chargers’ Week 1 running back depth is shaky at the moment, with Najee Harris’ (eye) availability still up in the air.</description>

      <title>Free agent WR Javon Baker worked out for the Eagles on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f7f5-de13-afdc-f7ff01100000</link>
      <description>Both Baker and Rice are former Day 3 picks. Neither player had a great preseason. Baker caught 1-of-10 targets for 13 yards with the Patriots while Rice caught 3-of-9 targets for 32 yards with the Chargers. They are not on the fantasy radar at this time.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports that the Patriots have a “strong internal belief that quarterback Drake Maye will take another step forward” in 2025.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f784-d332-a1fd-f7b6cc5a0000</link>
      <description>Maye took over as the Patriots’ starter in Week 6 last year and produced five QB1 finishes thereafter. The towering dual-threat should be drafted as a high-upside QB1 after having an “impressive initial offseason with coach Mike Vrabel and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.” He enters 2025 with significantly improved skill position players around him.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports that the Patriots are “ecstatic” over rookie RB TreVeyon Henderson, “so don’t be surprised if he turns into their lead option.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f812-dbe3-a9bb-f853c3d20000</link>
      <description>Earlier this week, Howe’s colleague, Chad Graff, said he believes Henderson could get half of the Patriots’ backfield carries or more. The explosive rookie is already a good bet to handle passing down duties. Becoming the lead rusher could make returning value on his late-fourth-round ADP a non-issue. Henderson can be viewed as an RB2 with RB1 upside, who will likely command larger touch counts as the season progresses.</description>

      <title>Patriots WR Kayshon Boutte has had a “stunning” offseason turnaround</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f81f-db7b-a5dd-f81f83330000</link>
      <description>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe lists Boutte alongside Stefon Diggs and DeMario Douglas as the three Patriots wide receivers who have had good training camps. The report is in line with observations shared by ESPN’s Mike Reiss earlier this month. Boutte seems to have secured the No. 3 wide receiver role. He has long odds of returning flex value reliably but he is a name to know for deep league, late-round dart throws.</description>

      <title>Patriots CB Christian Gonzalez’s hamstring injury has been “tricky” and the timetable on his return is “tough to pin down.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f824-d332-a1fd-fe36dd0e0000</link>
      <description>Gonzalez strained his hamstring on July 28th and reports initially indicated his Week 1 availability had not been jeopardized. His status for the Patriots’ opening game against the Raiders is now uncertain. The Patriots notably face the Dolphins and their speedy wideouts in Week 2.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports Chargers DC Jesse Minter and Packers DC Jeff Hafley could be head coaching candidates in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f820-db7b-a5dd-f82448570000</link>
      <description>Not all ownership groups are sold on the idea of hiring an offensive-minded head coach, though the approach certainly reduces the expected turnover rate when fielding a successful offense. For those interested in an old school approach, Howe believes teams in search of a “defense-minded approach” will be doing their homework on Minter and Hafley.</description>
