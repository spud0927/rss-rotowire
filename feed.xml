      <title>Woody Marks rushed 10 times for 15 yards in the Texans’ Week 7 loss to the Seahawks, adding three receptions for 20 yards and one touchdown.</title>

      <description>Marks benefited from the Texans’ trailing game script, but RB Dare Ogunbowale is still rotating in, which hurts Marks’ upside. The rookie running back is far and away the most explosive player in the Texans’ backfield, and he was encouragingly on the field for third and fourth downs, the two-minute drill and in the red zone. Late in the game, Marks was involved on three straight plays in scoring position. On the first, Texans QB CJ Stroud targeted Marks just inside the end zone, but Seahawks LB Drake Thomas knocked the pass out of Marks’ hands. Marks was bottled up for a one-yard loss on the second play, but Stroud looked his way after escaping pressure and the two successfully connected in the end zone thanks to a diving catch by the rookie running back. Marks seemingly winced in pain after securing the diving catch, so his Wednesday practice participation is worth monitoring. He is a low-end RB2 against the 49ers in Week 8.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Rich Cimini believes QB Tyrod Taylor is a better fit for the Jets offense than Justin Fields.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0225-d99b-a1df-3a2dded00000</link>
      <description>Fields was benched in favor of Taylor last week against the Panthers after a miserable first half for Fields. Taylor completed ten of 22 attempts for 126 scoreless yards, along with two picks. Even so, he got the ball out on time and pushed the ball downfield a handful of times in the second half. “With protection, Taylor can be functional from the pocket, which seems to fit better with offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand’s scheme,” Cimini said. Taylor, who ranks among the top ten most accurate quarterbacks this season, would be a fantasy boon for Garrett Wilson and the rest of the team’s pass catchers if he takes over for Fields. Taylor should be rostered in all superflex formats.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Kevin Seifert reports Vikings QB Max Brosmer “could be an option” for Week 8 against the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-06ec-d651-a9df-6ffd7ec20000</link>
      <description>With Carson Wentz (shoulder) once again banged up following the team’s Week 7 loss to the Eagles, Brosmer might be forced into action on Thursday against the Chargers. J.J. McCarthy, apparently still dealing with his ankle issue, appears to be a long shot for Week 8. “We’ll see how [Wentz] turns over,” Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell said after the team’s Week 7 loss. “I know Max was ready to go today and J.J. was the emergency three, but J.J. was able to get some work last week. We’ll see how he feels as well and on a short week.” Brosmer would likely be a major downgrade for Justin Jefferson and the rest of the Minnesota pass catchers against a solid Chargers secondary.</description>

      <title>Nico Collins was diagnosed with a concussion after the Texans’ Week 7 game against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-06f5-da18-a39a-def7c8d30000</link>
      <description>Collins’ head slammed against the turf on a fourth quarter incompletion on Monday Night Football. He exited the game and did not return. Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said the team would monitor Collins in the coming days. Collins will likely enter the NFL’s concussion protocol and is in danger of missing Houston’s Week 8 game against the Niners. If Collins is sidelined, the Texans will be forced to rely on Xavier Hutchinson and the rookie duo of Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel against the 49ers. Christian Kirk has been sidelined with a hamstring injury.</description>

      <title>Jacksonville.com’s Demetrius Harvey believes Travis Hunter’s role in the Jaguars offense is “ever evolving.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-073a-da18-a39a-df3b680e0000</link>
      <description>Hunter last week finally broke out in a loss to the Rams, catching eight of his 14 targets for 101 yards and a touchdown. Hunter was targeted on 27 percent of his pass routes — far higher than his season-long rate of 19 percent. Harvey said Hunter’s role in the offense could remain somewhat limited going forward. “They currently play him in slot only. That does limit him because of the lack of two wideout sets,” Harvey said. A Brian Thomas absence could change that calculus, however. Thomas left last week’s game with an apparent shoulder injury. Hunter played just 14 defensive snaps against the Rams, one of his lowest totals of the year.</description>

      <title>Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said WR Calvin Austin (shoulder) could return to practice this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0749-d99b-a1df-3f4d9f7c0000</link>
      <description>Tomlin said Tuesday that he’s “optimistic” Austin can return to game action in Week 8 against the Packers after missing the past few weeks with a serious shoulder injury. Austin had been operating as the team’s WR2 behind DK Metcalf before the injury, seeing 17 targets over four games. Austin would barely be a deep league WR option if he’s able to suit up this week against Green Bay.</description>

      <title>Titans DC Dennard Wilson said “guys will have to step up” without L’Jarius Sneed (quad) against the Colts in Week 8.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07b7-df81-ab9b-7ff708470000</link>
      <description>Sneed left Week 7’s game against the Patriots and was quickly ruled out. This seems to confirm he has little chance to play this week. Frankly, with how poorly Sneed has been playing in his limited snaps, the Titans could probably use those snaps to evaluate younger players. The Sneed contract has been a boondoggle for Tennessee through two years.</description>

      <title>Trey Wingo reports that the Cowboys have “made inquiries” about Raiders EDGE Maxx Crosby.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07cb-da18-a39a-dfdb49480000</link>
      <description>This is both not a typical source for us to use and something that we doubt comes to fruition without Crosby asking out of Las Vegas, but it is clear that the Cowboys are big-game hunting to replace Micah Parsons. They do have a first-round pick war chest, so nothing can be ruled out. We anticipate the Cowboys will likely have to settle for some more marginal upgrades, but then again, we’d also have anticipated that they’d just keep Parsons.</description>

      <title>Jets owner Woody Johnson said the Jets offense “would look good” if “we can just complete a pass.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07d3-da18-a39a-dfd3973e0000</link>
      <description>Welp. That’ll be one for the career obituary on Justin Fields. It seems clear that the Jets owner has not soured on Aaron Glenn and instead believes that the Fields play was simply a mistake. The Jets have not announced anything about who their quarterback will be this week, but ownership doesn’t usually just say something like this about a pass offense with a quarterback they intend to keep starting.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07d3-da18-a39a-dfd3973e0000</guid>

      <title>ESPN’s Rich Cimini reports the Jets are “moving toward” naming Tyrod Taylor the starter.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07d9-da18-a39a-dfdbaf3d0000</link>
      <description>Well, yeah. Consider this a companion blurb to what we just posted about Justin Fields. We sincerely doubt that Taylor is going to stay healthy for longer than a month at 36 years old, but he can competently shepherd the passing offense in a way that Fields simply hasn’t. Add up a game against the Bengals defense to the ledger and suddenly Taylor is squarely on the QB2 superflex line in a week with six teams on bye.</description>
