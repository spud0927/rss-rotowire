      <title>Buccaneers signed CB Tre Avery, formerly of the Patriots, to a contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d358-dbe3-a9bb-f35be8f70000</link>
      <description>Avery forced one incompletion on eight targets, playing for the Patriots in the 2025 preseason. He played for both the Titans and 49ers in 2024. The Buccaneers waived WR Jaden Smith in a corresponding move.</description>

      <title>Patriots waived TE Jaheim Bell.</title>

      <description>Bell was an intriguing receiving tight end in the 2024 NFL Draft. The Patriots also waived RB Micah Bernard, DT Philip Blidi, DB Isaiah Bolden, TE Cole Fotheringham, WR Phil Lutz, LB R.J. Moten, CB Jordan Polk, OG Tyrese Robinson, OG Sidy Sow, RB Shane Watts and QB Ben Wooldridge and released DT Kyle Peko, LB Monty Rice</description>

      <title>Steelers DT Derrick Harmon (knee) expected to miss “about a month” and is a candidate to begin the year on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d373-d332-a1fd-d77721620000</link>
      <description>Harmon was diagnosed with an MCL sprain. No word yet on the specific severity. Being placed on injured reserve would require him to miss at least four games, and the Steelers notably have a Week 5 bye. The good news is that the Steelers will get their first-round rookie back this year. The bad news is that they face four capable rushing offenses to begin the year (Jets, Seahawks, Patriots and Vikings).</description>

      <title>Seahawks OT Charles Cross (finger) participated in team drills on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d31b-dbe3-a9bb-f35bdf930000</link>
      <description>The occasion marks Cross’ first full-contact practice participation since late July. ESPN’s Brady Henderson reports that this “puts him ahead of [head coach Mike] Macdonald’s initial timeline and serves as an obvious indication he’ll be play[ing] in the opener.” It’s great news for Sam Darnold, who has the 49ers’ pass rush on tap in Week 1.</description>

      <title>Texans released TE Dalton Keene.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d3af-de13-afdc-d7ef6b7f0000</link>
      <description>The Texans released Keene (hamstring) and waived WR Xavier Johnson (hand) from injured reserve with injury settlements. Both moves are in relation to cutdown day, coming up next week.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d3af-de13-afdc-d7ef6b7f0000</guid>

      <title>The Exhibit’s Josina Anderson reports the Vikings are “not likely” to trade for Panthers WR Adam Thielen “at this point.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d3cc-de13-afdc-d7cf7ccc0000</link>
      <description>That makes two national reporters who have pumped the brakes on a potential Thielen-Vikings reunion. Both Anderson and The Athletic’s Dianna Russini highlighted the potential deal’s financial speed bumps while also stopping short of fully ruling out the trade between the two teams at some point. If the Panthers are willing to take on some of Thielen’s contract to facilitate the trade, the Vikings might be willing to make the move.</description>

      <title>Bengals LB Demetrius Knight Jr. left practice early after suffering a “lower extremity injury” on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d361-dbe3-a9bb-f373f2250000</link>
      <description>The Bengals spent a second-round pick on Knight this offseason, and the rookie was penciled in as the team’s co-starter alongside LB Logan Wilson. The Bengals’ defense is already talent-deficient and EDGE Trey Hendrickson’s contract dispute has not yet been resolved. Bengals LB Oren Burks is Knight’s primary competition for the starting role and has had a strong camp. The injury could push the rookie into a backup role to begin the year.</description>

      <title>Patrick Mahomes completed 8-of-13 for 143 yards and one touchdown and rushed once for 18 yards in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d46a-dbe3-a9bb-f47b823e0000</link>
      <description>Mahomes looked good, distributing the ball effectively across his receiving corps. The run game took over on the first drive once the offense entered the red zone, with Kareem Hunt getting the ball on first down before Isiah Pacheco found the end zone from two yards out on second. Mahomes notably targeted rookie RB Brashard Smith twice on the drive. Smith dropped a would-be first-down pass on 2nd-and-10 but Mahomes went back to him three plays later and the two connected for a 12-yard gain. Mahomes then led the offense to a field goal on the second drive by linking up with Tyquan Thornton for 58 yards. He made it a point to get the remaining starters involved on the third drive, which he capped off with a touchdown pass thrown to Rashee Rice.</description>

      <title>Rashee Rice caught 2-of-2 targets for 13 yards and one touchdown in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d3c5-dbe3-a9bb-f3d719320000</link>
      <description>Rice nearly hauled in a long pass from Patrick Mahomes on the second play from scrimmage but CB Nahshon Wright interfered, resulting in both defensive pass interference and face mask penalties. Rice scored on the Chiefs’ third drive, gaining handsy separation on an end zone fade. He’s a risky pick due to the potential suspension but when on-field, he makes a strong case for WR1 consideration.</description>

      <title>Isiah Pacheco rushed three times for 21 yards and one touchdown in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d47e-db7b-a5dd-f47e0a8e0000</link>
      <description>Pacheco surrendered the Chiefs’ first touch inside the Bears’ five-yard line to Kareem Hunt, but Hunt gained just one yard and Pacheco punched it in on the following play. Pacheco looked like his normal, hard-running, speedy self in this one. Hunt’s red zone involvement is unideal but Pacheco could return RB2 value via his seventh-round ADP.</description>
