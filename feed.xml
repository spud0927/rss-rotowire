      <title>Cardinals OC Drew Petzing said after rewatching Week 5’s loss to the Titans, he felt he didn’t do enough to get the ball to Marvin Harrison Jr.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c024-dd4c-afb9-e7e5e9a70000</link>
      <description>Harrison only had five targets despite a 98-yard day for the Cardinals in Week 5, though some of them were of course buried with the Cardinals trying to kill clock before the hilarious ending of their game. “Going back and looking at it, I think there’s maybe a couple things I could’ve done differently.” Petzing told reporters. These sorts of confessions don’t always lead to increased production the next week, and Petzing seems way too conservative in general to get Harrison to the WR1 land we were promised, but perhaps the combination of a good Colts offense and the #SqueakyWheel narrative could make something come together for Harrison in Week 6.</description>

      <title>Jaguars placed Brenton Strange (hip) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c036-db72-a199-fa7fb7e30000</link>
      <description>He’ll miss at least four games. It’s a big loss for the Jaguars, Strange had a 22-yard reception in Week 6 and was one of the team’s leading receivers over the past month. Hunter Long saw a huge boost in playing time, up to 35 snaps after never previously playing more than 22 in a game this year, in in Strange’s absence. It’s hard to recommend Long as a streamer given his lack of career production, but the role is there for him to be a TE2 in some leagues. NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reported Strange is expected to miss about a month, which should put him in line for a Week 11 return.</description>

      <title>Chargers acquired EDGE Odafe Oweh and a 2027 seventh-round pick from the Ravens for S Alohi Gilman and a 2026 fifth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c04d-d94a-a79d-c94d5d060000</link>
      <description>The Ravens have kicked their feet on extending Oweh — this is his fifth-year option season — and ultimately weren’t going to be able to pay everybody. The Chargers needed help at EDGE following Khalil Mack’s injury and Oweh is a decent in-season add without much of a price. Still just 26, Oweh raises the floor of Los Angeles’ defense. The rest of the cost is Gilman, a decent starter over the course of his career who can give the Ravens somebody to let Kyle Hamilton freelance when Hamilton is healthy again. It’s an interesting challenge trade for both sides. Gilman is also in the final year of his contract.</description>

      <title>Chargers signed RB Nyheim Hines to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c061-db72-a199-fa6bffb70000</link>
      <description>Hines has a chance to play immediately with the Chargers running back position in shambles following the Omarion Hampton injury. He’d certainly make some sense as a passing-downs caddy for Hassan Haskins. We’ll likely need some coach quotes to verify how likely it is that Hines will be active. Haskins is probably the favorite for early-down duties.</description>

      <title>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he reduced Pat Freiermuth’s role in Week 4 because he wanted bigger bodies to block Minnesota’s 4-3 front.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c06e-dd4c-afb9-e7efd9750000</link>
      <description>“You can’t play 4-3 teams with 250-pound tight ends,” Tomlin said. Not that fantasy managers needed another variable to keep track of after Freiermuth had just 65 yards over his first four games — Freiermuth should be long gone on most rosters — but if the Steelers are going to limit his snaps in some situations, he stands to be hard to start in even deeper leagues.</description>

      <title>Saints waived RB Velus Jones Jr.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c074-dd4c-afb9-e7f510ab0000</link>
      <description>Jones received two offensive snaps in five games with the Saints, operating as a returner. He’ll likely look to continue his career on a practice squad elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Colts placed CB Mike Hilton on practice squad injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c0be-def2-abdb-ddff6f610000</link>
      <description>Hilton signed with the Colts after Week 3 and started two games for the team. The 31-year-old tallied five combined tackles and a forced fumble as he helped cover for slot cornerback Kenny Moore’s absence due to a calf injury. Hilton was technically on the practice squad, so he goes on the injured reserve there. The Colts signed Troy Pride to the practice squad in a corresponding move.</description>

      <title>The Cardinals fined head coach Jonathan Gannon $100,000 for a sideline altercation with RB Emari Demercado.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c0de-d94a-a79d-c9df6fe30000</link>
      <description>The altercation happened during the Cardinals’ Week 5 loss to the Titans after Demercado dropped the ball before crossing the goal line on a would-be 72-yard score. The NFL will not discipline Gannon further. The Cardinals are 2-3 and Gannon is 14-25 over the course of his coaching tenure.</description>

      <title>Eagles RB Saquon Barkley (knee) was limited in Tuesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c0e1-dd4c-afb9-e7e1b36b0000</link>
      <description>Barkley was listed as DNP on Monday but gets a limited designation on Tuesday. He is still expected to play Thursday against the Giants as his knee issue seems to be a minor injury. Another limited or full designation on Wednesday would give fantasy managers more confidence, but expect Barkley to suit up Thursday night.</description>

      <title>Saints hosted WRs K.J. Osborn, Mecole Hardman, and Ronnie Bell for workouts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c10a-dd4c-afb9-e7cb96fb0000</link>
      <description>The Saints are looking to add receiver depth and hosted a trio of wideouts for tryouts Tuesday. Osborn was cut by the Commanders prior to the start of the season while the Packers let Hardman go last month. Bell was also released by the Lions last month. Between the three, the Saints signed Bell to their practice squad.</description>
