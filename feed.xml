      <title>DeAndre Hopkins caught both targets for 35 yards and a touchdown in the Ravens’ Week 1 loss to the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2795-dbe3-a9bb-37d746bc0000</link>
      <description>Hopkins made a spectacular, one-handed grab through two defenders for a touchdown in the third quarter, giving the Ravens their second 15-point lead of the final frame. Two three-and-outs and a Derrick Henry fumble allowed the Bills to score 16 unanswered points in the final four minutes to snatch the victory away. Hopkins was not in a route enough to return consistent fantasy production, something likely to remain the case throughout the season as the aging veteran adapts to a reduced role.</description>

      <title>Rashod Bateman caught 2-of-4 targets for 10 yards in the Ravens’ Week 1 loss to the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2798-db7b-a5dd-a79c80210000</link>
      <description>Bateman was an afterthought in the offensive game plan as the Ravens played with a lead for most of the game. His four targets ranked second on the team behind only Zay Flowers, but were not enough to return any fantasy value on just 19 Lamar Jackson pass attempts. Bateman remains a touchdown-dependent fantasy asset on a run-heavy offense in Baltimore.</description>

      <title>49ers signed RT Colton McKivitz to a three-year, $45 million contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-294e-dbe3-a9bb-395faaab0000</link>
      <description>McKivitz was in the final year of his deal and is now tied to the Niners through the 2028 season. The sixth-year tackle cemented himself as a starter in 2023 and has started all 35 regular-season games he’s appeared in since then. McKivitz allowed just two sacks on 36 pressures last season, turning in arguably the best year while earning a PFF blocking grade of 72.2. His solid performances and availability over the years make McKivitz an easy player to invest in for the foreseeable future, and should solidify the Niners’ right side of the line for three more years.</description>

      <title>NFL insider Jordan Schultz reports the Eagles are hosting free agent CB Mike Hilton for a visit.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-298c-d332-a1fd-bfbe5ed20000</link>
      <description>Hilton has spent the last four seasons with the Bengals. He appeared in 16 games for them last season, totaling 73 tackles and one interception while also breaking up five passes. The Eagles’ corners struggled at times in the team’s Week 1 win over the Cowboys and could benefit from adding a veteran like Hilton to shore up a secondary that C.J. Gardner-Johnson and Darius Slay this offseason. If signed, Hilton shouldn’t be viewed as anything more than a depth player who can contribute in nickel and dime packages.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Christian Darrisaw’s (knee) “status is murky” for Week 1’s game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2998-db7b-a5dd-a99c16820000</link>
      <description>Darrisaw was listed as questionable entering the weekend but may be trending toward missing Monday night’s Week 1 game against the Bears. Darrisaw suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 8 of last season. Rapoport suggests that even if Darrisaw does play, the team may opt to take it easy on him in his return, which could lead to backup Justin Skule seeing more snaps than initially expected.</description>

      <title>Jets HC Aaron Glenn said Allen Lazard was inactive for Week 1 due to the two weeks of camp he missed.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-29ad-db7b-a5dd-a9ad52d90000</link>
      <description>Glenn didn’t say if Lazard would be active for Week 2’s game against the Bills, but said the decision to scratch him for Week 1 was made because they want to make sure he’s up to speed with the offense. Garrett Wilson led the Jets with 7-95-1 through the air in Sunday’s loss, but fellow receivers Tyler Johnson and Josh Reynolds combined for just four receptions for 49 additional yards. Lazard won’t make for a huge upgrade at the position, but he should provide a bit more than Johnson and Reynolds did if he’s active next week.</description>

      <title>Browns TE Harold Fannin played 55 snaps in Week 1’s loss to the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-29b6-d332-a1fd-bfb66d850000</link>
      <description>The snap total comes courtesy of PFF. Fannin, who surprised with a receiving line of 7-63-0 on a team-high nine targets, saw the fourth-most snaps of any Browns offensive position player in Week 1, and found himself lining up all over the formations. In addition to playing 41.7 percent of his snaps in the slot, Fannin also lined up 29 times as an inline tight end and took three snaps out of the backfield. It’s only one week, but Fannin’s usage was no fluke. He’s a priority add in all formats for fantasy managers looking to improve at tight end.</description>

      <title>DeAndre Hopkins ran 12 routes in the Ravens’ Week 1 loss to the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a0e-dbe3-a9bb-3a5ff8850000</link>
      <description>In a game that saw the Ravens’ offense produce 40 points, the route totals run by their pass-catchers were shockingly low. Zay Flowers led the group with 22 on the evening, per PFF, while Hopkins’ 12 routes ranked fifth-fewest on the team, ahead of only Derrick Henry. Hopkins was always expected to see a reduced role after signing with the Ravens this offseason, but his 12 routes in a high-scoring Week 1 affair that saw the team drop back just 22 teams is an indicator his fantasy value could be worse than we initially suspected.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Terrion Arnold’s groin injury is not thought to be serious.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a19-d332-a1fd-be3f029f0000</link>
      <description>Whether or not Arnold misses any time is to be determined, but it sounds like the second-year corner avoided anything major after exiting in Week 1’s game against the Packers. Arnold appeared in 16 games as a rookie last season, totaling 60 tackles and 10 pass breakups while earning a PFF coverage grade of 50.2. He allowed 86 receiving yards and one touchdown in Week 1’s loss to the Packers, per PFF. We’ll likely know in the coming days if he’ll have a chance to suit up in Week 2 when the Lions take on the Bears.</description>

      <title>49ers signed WR Kendrick Bourne, formerly of the Patriots, to a one-year contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a1f-db7b-a5dd-aa1fadb20000</link>
      <description>Bourne’s signing comes a week after he met with the Niners to discuss a possible reunion, and less than 24 hours after Jauan Jennings suffered a shoulder injury in Sunday’s win over the Seahawks. Bourne was let go by the Patriots during roster cutdowns last month and underwhelmed to the tune of 28-305-1 in 12 games after returning from a torn ACL he suffered in 2023. After spending the first four years of his career with the Niners in Kyle Shanahan’s offense, Bourne could make for an easy plug-and-play from an offensive perspective, but it’s hard to imagine him having much, if any, fantasy value at this time. Bourne can earn up to $5 million on his one-year deal.</description>
