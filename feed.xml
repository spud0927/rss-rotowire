      <title>Giants listed RB Tyrone Tracy (shoulder) as limited on Monday’s estimated practice report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-bae8-d94a-a79d-bbedac740000</link>
      <description>Tracy was a DNP in two of three practices last week but managed to log a limited session on Friday. Monday isn’t an official practice day, but a limited designation on Monday is still an encouraging sign. The Giants face the Eagles on a short week as they draw the Thursday night matchup in Week 6. If Tracy does return, we would expect him to eat into Cam Skattebo’s workload, which could make both backs difficult to trust against a stout Eagles defense.</description>

      <title>Bengals coach Zac Taylor said “like all personnel decisions, we have to evaluate it” when asked about Jake Browning starting in Week 6.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-baec-d94a-a79d-bbedc7e80000</link>
      <description>The “evaluate it” bit is often the first step before a quarterback gets relieved of their duties. Browning’s confidence sounded shot in interviews after the game, and it would be surprising if the Bengals didn’t have a new quarterback at some point in the near future. The problem is that the only other one on their roster is Brett Rypien, and the Bengals are not often a team that has made win-now trades in search of better options. Still, throwing the “evaluate” quote out there shows that Browning won’t hold this job much longer without an immediate turnaround — if he’s given the chance — in Week 6.</description>

      <title>Lions coach Dan Campbell said Terrion Arnold (shoulder) is going to be out for “a long time.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-baf3-d94a-a79d-bbff2cda0000</link>
      <description>So probably an IR stint ahead for Arnold. The Lions are down their top three cornerbacks entering the season and that should help them be more of a get-right spot for receivers going forward — as they were for Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins last week — as they flail around with Amik Robertson and depth pieces in front of Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph.</description>

      <title>Free agent WR Treylon Burks (collarbone) has been cleared to return to football activities.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-baee-dd4c-afb9-ffef10b30000</link>
      <description>Burks was placed on the waived/injured list by the Titans following his injury in training camp. After going unclaimed, Burks is now free to sign with any team. The former first-round pick has struggled to live up to the expectations that made him the No. 18 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, posting a career receiving line of 53-699-1 in 27 career games while battling multiple injuries along the way. Still only 25 years old, Burks is an ideal practice squad candidate for any team looking to improve their wide receiver room, but it’s hard to imagine him making much of an impact wherever he may land this season.</description>

      <title>Commanders coach Dan Quinn said he’s “optimistic” about Terry McLaurin (quad) for Week 6.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-bb13-d94a-a79d-bb1f446f0000</link>
      <description>The Commanders do have an extra day of rest ahead of Monday Night Football. It is worth pointing out that Quinn said McLaurin was “trending in the right direction” last week before a DNP-DNP-Ruleout, so the optimism doesn’t exactly mean much until we see McLaurin in practice. Still, it doesn’t sound like this will drag on too much longer based on reports from ESPN last week and we’d anticipate McLaurin showing up in Week 6 or Week 7.</description>

      <title>Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said Carson Wentz (shoulder) is “being further evaluated.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-bb1c-d94a-a79d-bb1d78690000</link>
      <description>Wentz briefly left Week 5’s game in England with the shoulder injury, but it happened close enough to halftime that the Vikings didn’t actually do much without Wentz on the field. The Vikings are on bye, and the fact that he was able to play through it in Week 5 is encouraging, but there’s no such thing as a good “further evaluation” in the NFL. Wentz being hurt would make turning the keys back over to J.J. McCarthy easier after Wentz went 2-1 over three games, assuming McCarthy comes back healed from his high-ankle sprain, anyway.</description>

      <title>Titans HC Brian Callahan said Tyjae Spears’ role will see an increased role going forward.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-baf8-d94a-a79d-bbfdd98a0000</link>
      <description>This is a true “take it with a grain of salt” statement from Callahan. Spears played on 17 snaps in his Week 5 return and saw exactly zero targets. If his role didn’t increase beyond what we saw in Week 5, then Spears would have no role. With that in mind, it’s worth keeping in mind what Spears’ role looked like under Callahan last season. He averaged just 9.5 opportunities per game in 2024 which made him nearly impossible to trust for fantasy, but averaged 16.3 opportunities per game in the final three weeks of a lost season. Spears is a worthwhile stash in deeper leagues, but still faces competition for touches from Tony Pollard and plays in one of the worst offenses in the league. It’s hard to imagine there being much, if any, weekly upside here as long as Pollard is active.</description>

      <title>Bills coach Sean McDermott said Matt Milano (pectoral) aggravated his injury in Week 5 and is “week to week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-bb28-db72-a199-fb6bbfaf0000</link>
      <description>That almost assures we won’t see any Milano this week. Milano has just a 34.2 PFF grade while struggling through three games on injury and wasn’t much better last year — he simply hasn’t been the same player he was in 2022 in a long time at this point. The Bills should probably consider an IR stint to just get him as healthy as he can be for a playoff run, so McDermott naturally said that IR is not a consideration at this time.</description>

      <title>Vikings HC Kevin O’Connell said J.J. McCarthy (ankle) will practice following the team’s Week 6 bye.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-bb2b-db72-a199-fb6bd6cb0000</link>
      <description>McCarthy was expected to practice late last week, but some inclement weather on Friday kept the QB sidelined out of precaution. In addition to McCarthy, O’Connell also said LG Donovan Jackson, C Michael Jurgens, and LB Blake Cashman are also expected to practice after the team’s Week 6 bye. With a Week 7 game against the Eagles on the horizon, the hope is that the Vikings will have several key players back in a pivotal NFC matchup.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-bb2b-db72-a199-fb6bd6cb0000</guid>

      <title>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said Omarion Hampton (ankle) will be placed on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-bb2f-d94a-a79d-bb2f3f600000</link>
      <description>He’ll miss at least the next four games. It’s devastating fantasy news as Hampton had just taken on a more-or-less full-time role in Los Angeles’ backfield. Without him, they’ll form a committee with Hassan Haskins and Kimani Vidal leading the way. Haskins is probably the better bet for fantasy managers since he has actually spent some of this year on the roster. We would not expect miracles out of either player, but a Week 6 matchup with the team that brought you “Rico Dowdle, 200-yard rusher” should make Haskins a borderline RB2/FLEX play.</description>
