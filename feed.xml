      <title>49ers WR Ricky Pearsall (ankle/knee) is questionable to play in Week 17 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5ccb-d968-a19b-5cfb8f2d0000</link>
      <description>Pearsall has been practicing in a limited capacity this week, though we do not yet know his official participation level for Friday. If he can suit up against the Bears this weekend, he can only be viewed as a boom-bust FLEX option. Pearsall has demonstrated intriguing route running abilities this season, but knee and ankle injuries continue to slow him down.</description>

      <title>Rams WR Davante Adams (hamstring) was not seen practicing on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5ccf-d35e-a1bf-5dcfd8310000</link>
      <description>We do not expect Adams to play this week. The 33-year-old wide receiver has already aggravated the multi-week injury once, and the Rams (11-4) have secured a playoff spot. On the off chance he plays, he would be a candidate to score a touchdown, operating in his featured red zone role, but he makes for a dicey play overall. Just two days ago, ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported that the Rams may “shut down” Adams for the final two games of the regular season.</description>

      <title>Raiders RB Raheem Mostert (knee/ankle) is questionable to play in Week 17 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5cd6-dc7a-af9b-dfffad9e0000</link>
      <description>Mostert has not been fantasy-relevant, but with the Raiders have shutting down TE Brock Bowers (knee) and EDGE Maxx Crosby (knee), we figure all skill position players are worth keeping an eye on. Mostert sits in second on the depth chart, with RB Zamir White and RB Dylan Laube behind him.</description>

      <title>Raiders WR Jack Bech (back) is questionable to play in Week 17 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5cd6-d56e-afff-fefeb6b50000</link>
      <description>The Raiders’ second-round rookie has not had a good season. Bech has caught 20-of-26 targets for 224 scoreless yards, while averaging 1.27 yards per route run. Hopefully, Bech can return in time for Week 18, so he can put something decent on film before the team begins evaluating its pre-draft needs.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes that hiring a new offensive coordinator and play caller “could make a lot of sense” for the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5ce4-dc7a-af9b-dfff43780000</link>
      <description>Lions head coach Dan Campbell took play-calling duties from OC John Morton in Week 10. The offense averaged 5.8 yards per play in Weeks 1-9 and 6.1 from Weeks 10-17. Campbell could feasibly keep play-calling duties in 2026, though he may wish to hand that responsibility off to an up-and-coming offensive mind.</description>

      <title>NBC Sports Bay Area’s Matt Maiocco reports that it is “possible” for LB Fred Warner (ankle) to return late in the playoffs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5ddd-dc7a-af9b-dfffee5a0000</link>
      <description>Per a source, “Warner could make a push to be available for the NFC Championship Game, if the 49ers are able to advance that far in the postseason.” 49ers GM John Lynch acknowledged that “it would be well ahead of the original timeline we were given,” but it is possible for Warner to return if he can meet the “objective measurements” placed in front of him by team doctors. Per Maiocco, “Lynch sounded more optimistic” than he had been previously, when discussing whether Warner could “play again this season.” Warner’s return is far from guaranteed, as is the 49ers’ theoretical playoff run, but this is now a story worth following. Stay tuned.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports 49ers LB Fred Warner (ankle) is ahead of schedule and a return for the NFC Championship game is “possible.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-60e3-d968-a19b-78f3da4f0000</link>
      <description>Rapoport’s report comes on the heels of a report from NBC Sports Bay Area’s Matt Maiocco Friday essentially saying the same thing, though Rapoport explicitly states that Warner is ahead of schedule in his recovery from ankle surgery. While that’s great news, we’ve seen this song and dance before. Warner’s return would require him returning to play well ahead of his original injury timeline as well as a 49ers run to the NFC Championship game without him. It would be a great story, but remains a long-shot at best.</description>

      <title>Giants TE Theo Johnson (illness) is out for Week 17’s game against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-60f2-d56e-afff-e6fa1fc40000</link>
      <description>Johnson was added to the injury report late in the week with an illness and missed altogether Friday. The 24-year-old tight end won’t even travel with the team to Las Vegas this week. His absence thins out an already thin Giants tight end group, though it’s unlikely many fantasy managers were counting on Johnson after putting up a zero in Week 16.</description>

      <title>Falcons WR Drake London (knee) is questionable for Week 17 against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6124-d56e-afff-e7ec03670000</link>
      <description>London returned from a four-game absence in Week 16 to play 69% of the team’s offensive snaps. He logged a week of limited sessions before drawing the questionable tag for the team’s Week 17 meeting with the Rams on Monday Night Football. Fantasy managers can likely plan to start London in the Championship round as he should suit up, regardless of the fact he carries a designation through the weekend.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6124-d56e-afff-e7ec03670000</guid>

      <title>Rams WR Davante Adams (hamstring) is doubtful for Week 17 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6158-d968-a19b-79f93d5e0000</link>
      <description>Adams has dealt with multiple hamstring issues in his age-33 season, making it likely he is held out for Monday Night Football in Week 17. The Rams have legitimate Super Bowl aspirations and are likely to take a cautious approach with their red zone weapon. Fantasy managers counting on Adams in Championship week are better off looking elsewhere for help at wide receiver unless all other options are exhausted.</description>
