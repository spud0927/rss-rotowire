      <title>49ers ruled out WR Ricky Pearsall (knee) for Week 6 against the Buccaneers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cff3-def2-abdb-dff39e360000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported last week that Pearsall “could be back” for Week 6. Unfortunately, Pearsall failed to practice even once in a limited capacity this week. Despite missing the 49ers’ Week 5 game against the Rams, Pearsall ranks 16th, positionally, with 327 receiving yards. Hopefully, he can return for next week’s game against the Falcons.</description>

      <title>49ers QB Mac Jones (knee/oblique) is questionable to play in Week 6 against the Buccaneers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cf4e-def2-abdb-df6f7a8c0000</link>
      <description>Jones remained limited through all three practices this week and was able to participate in throwing drills on Friday. With starting QB Brock Purdy already ruled out and Jones able to practice, the 49ers’ No. 2 quarterback is in line to start, pending good health on Sunday. Jones has two QB1 finishes and one QB2 finish in three games played this season. He deserves to be treated as a borderline QB1/2 against the Buccaneers’ pass-funnel defense this week.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (ankle/ribs) is questionable to play in Week 6 against the Buccaneers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d012-db72-a199-fa5b10d00000</link>
      <description>Jennings took the day off on Wednesday before practicing in a limited capacity on Thursday and Friday. Fantasy managers can expect him to play on Sunday against the Buccaneers’ pass-funnel defense, though it will be worth monitoring the news for any updates on him. If active, Jennings can be started as a borderline WR2/3, operating as the 49ers’ No. 1 wide receiver with Ricky Pearsall (knee) sidelined.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers WR Chris Godwin is “expected” to be week-to-week, “depending on how he progresses,” after suffering a new fibula injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d058-d94a-a79d-d95d00c40000</link>
      <description>Godwin missed the first three weeks of the 2025 season after dislocating his ankle and fracturing his fibula in Week 7, 2024. This week, he appeared on Wednesday’s injury report with a fibula injury, prompting speculation that he had suffered a re-injury. However, per the Tampa Bay Times’ Rick Stroud, Godwin has injured his fibula in an entirely different location, though it may be on the same, previously injured lower leg. Stroud notes that “there are no plans for him to go on injured reserve at this time,” but his use of “expected” and “plans” is hardly reassuring. The Buccaneers are on bye in Week 9, so an injured reserve placement would render him ineligible to return until Week 11. One can only guess as to when Godwin will return, but allowing him to rest and rehab the injury through the Week 9 bye seems reasonable.</description>

      <title>Steelers signed DE K.J. Henry, formerly of the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d078-def2-abdb-dd79cd930000</link>
      <description>Henry last took regular season snaps as a member of the Cowboys in 2024, totaling two quarterback pressures and one sack. He joins the Steelers’ practice squad after spending last week on the Eagles’ practice squad.</description>

      <title>Bengals WR Ja’Marr Chase (illness) is expected to play in Week 6 against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d07d-d94a-a79d-d97d6b9c0000</link>
      <description>The illness caused Chase to leave practice early, during walkthroughs this morning, but sources say he will be on the field for Joe Flacco’s first game as a Cincinnati Bengal. Chase should be treated as an elite WR1 this week, hopefully, with vastly improved quarterback play. The superstar wide receiver caught 6-of-9 targets for 110 yards and two touchdowns en route to the overall WR1 finish last week after frustratingly finishing as the half-PPR WR36 and WR57 in Weeks 3 and 4, respectively.</description>

      <title>Falcons WR Darnell Mooney (hamstring) did not practice on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d0a6-def2-abdb-dde797c10000</link>
      <description>Earlier today, beat reporters observed Mooney “on the field in a helmet catching passes.” He appeared to be heading toward an official limited designation. Unfortunately, he was ultimately listed as a non-participant, which suggests his minimal activity must have taken place on a side field, perhaps with trainers. Although the Falcons do not play on Monday night, Mooney appears unlikely to suit up this week. Plan to be without him.</description>

      <title>Dianna Russini of the Athletic reports 49ers GM John Lynch is exploring the pass rusher trade market including checking on the availability of Bengals EDGE Trey Hendrickson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d3b2-def2-abdb-dff3af6b0000</link>
      <description>The dots are fairly easy to connect here. The 49ers are desperate for pass rush help after losing Nick Bosa to injury for the season. The Bengals gave Hendrickson a raise this past offseason, but the team is going nowhere with Joe Burrow also injured and Hendrickson is set to hit free agency this offseason. Hendrickson would likely be highly coveted if he was made available in trade before the NFL’s midseason trade deadline.</description>

      <title>Bills LB Matt Milano (pec) has been ruled out for Week 6 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d3f1-d94a-a79d-dbfd184d0000</link>
      <description>No surprise here. Bills coach Sean McDermott called Milano “week-to-week” after the 31-year-old linebacker re-aggravated his pectoral injury in Week 5. Milano missed multiple practices this week so ruling him out for Week 6’s Monday night showdown with the Falcons was an easy call. The Bills have a bye week in Week 7 so Milano will be afforded additional time off before the Bills play the Panthers in Week 8.</description>

      <title>Commanders WR Terry McLaurin (quad) has been ruled out for Week 6 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d413-def2-abdb-dd7304500000</link>
      <description>McLaurin was trending in the wrong direction with multiple missed practices this week. Now he’s officially been ruled out for Week 6’s matchup with the Bears, which will mark McLaurin’s third consecutive missed game. Deebo Samuel should dominate targets again for the Commanders with Luke McCaffrey seeing an increased role downfield.</description>
