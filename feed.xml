      <title>Tee Higgins (concussion) is active for Week 16 against the Dolphins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c3-da28-afbb-c5ff71540000</link>
      <description>Higgins sought extra assurance he was actually good to go after getting re-injured in Week 14 and missing Week 15, but the doctors told him what he needed to hear even with the Bengals’ playoff pursuit over. He can be treated as a borderline WR1. Inactive for the Bengals are QB Jake Browning, WR Charlie Jones, DB Brayln Lux, S P.J. Jules, EDGE Joseph Ossai, TE Noah Fant and DT Jordan Jefferson.</description>

      <title>Dolphins LB Jordyn Brooks (foot, knee) is active for Week 16 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c3-da28-afbb-c5fff86f0000</link>
      <description>One of the Dolphins’ better players this season, Brooks is good to go as they move on from Tua Tagovailoa at quarterback. Tua is merely the emergency QB3 this afternoon. Joining him on the shelf are S Minkah Fitzpatrick, WR Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, CB Isaiah Johnson, OL Kendall Lamm, DL Matthew Butler and WR Tahj Washington.</description>

      <title>Gunnar Helm (toe) is active for Week 16 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c5-d35e-a1bf-45c70bf00000</link>
      <description>As is Van Jefferson (back). It means this undermanned Titans skill corps is at least at full strength as it tries to steal a victory vs. the dazed and confused Chiefs. Inactive for the Titans are OL Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson, OL Garrett Dellinger, OL Drew Moss, DL Cam Horsley, LB Cedric Gray and S Erick Hallett.</description>

      <title>Bills declared WR Keon Coleman, K Matt Prater, S Darnell Savage, DT Jordan Phillips, OT Tylan Grable, and DT Larry Ogunjobi inactive for Week 16 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c3-dc7a-af9b-cffff2b60000</link>
      <description>Coleman didn’t record an official target in Week 15 against the Patriots and has been a healthy scratch on multiple occasions this season. Coleman has caught 36 passes for 355 yards and four touchdowns this season, but has caught just four passes in his last three games played.</description>

      <title>Giants declared WR Jalin Hyatt, WR Ryan Miller, LB Demetrius Flanagan-Fowles, OLB Caleb Murphy, OG Jon Runyan Jr., DL Rakeem Nunez-Roches, and QB Russell Wilson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c4-d35e-a1bf-45c69dea0000</link>
      <description>Given the Giants’ injuries at wide receiver, it’s unfortunate that Hyatt still can’t find a spot on the game-day roster. With just five catches for 35 yards this year, he will likely be looking for a new team in 2026.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c4-d35e-a1bf-45c69dea0000</guid>

      <title>Saints declared RB Alvin Kamara, S Ugo Amadi, CB Rejzohn Wright, RG Cesar Ruiz, T Asim Richards, TE Zaire Mitchell-Paden, and DT Khristian Boyd inactive for Week 16 against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c6-dc7a-af9b-cfff57650000</link>
      <description>Audric Estime is expected to function as the Saints’ lead back against the Jets with Kamara sidelined, though Evan Hull will mix in on passing downs. Estime can be played as a touchdown-dependent flex option in 12-team leagues while Hull is a desperation play in deeper formats.</description>

      <title>Panthers declared LT Ikem Ekwonu (knee) inactive for Week 16 against the Buccaneers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c2-da28-afbb-c5ffb2ba0000</link>
      <description>Ekwonu got in a limited practice on Friday, but it was not enough to be ready for Week 16 against the Buccaneers. Yosh Nijman will start in his place at left tackle. Panthers also declared WR Hunter Renfrow, LB Trevin Wallace, S Demani Richardson, DT Jared Harrison-Hunte, TE James Mitchell, and DT Tershawn Wharton inactive for Week 16 against the Buccaneers. Wallace (shoulder) and Wharton (hamstring) are out due to injury, while the others are healthy scratches.</description>

      <title>Gabe Davis is inactive for Week 16 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c7-d087-addf-f1f7e4c70000</link>
      <description>Davis didn’t play an offensive snap in Week 15 and has caught just seven passes for 88 yards this season. There’s no reason to continue stashing Davis in any format during the final three weeks of the season.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c7-d087-addf-f1f7e4c70000</guid>

      <title>Chiefs declared WR Rashee Rice (concussion) inactive for Kansas City’s Week 16 game against the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41c5-dc7a-af9b-cfffad830000</link>
      <description>He was declared out on Friday, as were most of the other Chiefs inactives today. Rice has a chance to come back last week, though Gardner Minshew taking over at quarterback significantly reduces his fantasy upside. The rest of the Chiefs inactives are: CB Trent McDuffie (knee), OL CJ Hanson, OT Jaylon Moore (knee), WR Tyquan Thornton (concussion), DT Derrick Nnadi (illness) and RB Dameon Pierce.</description>

      <title>Colts LT Bernhard Raimann (right elbow) will not play in Week 16 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-41d1-da28-afbb-c5fd1bba0000</link>
      <description>Raimann got in one limited practice this week before being listed as questionable for Monday’s game. Downgrading him to out this early means he wasn’t that close to suiting up. Raimann will eye a Week 17 return. Luke Tenuta took over for Raimann in Week 15 and could be the next man up once again.</description>
