      <title>Ravens hired assistant special teams coach Anthony Levine as their special teams coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4a7e-d629-a1bc-fa7f46f60000</link>
      <description>Levine spent his NFL career as a special teams standout for the Ravens, joining the team as an assistant special teams coach after retirement. With Chris Horton following John Harbaugh to the Giants’ coaching staff, Baltimore had a vacancy. Head coach Jesse Minter knows Levine from his days as a defensive assistant with the Ravens and now hires the 38-year-old as his special teams coordinator.</description>

      <title>Giants hired former Titans head coach Brian Callahan as the team’s quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4cfa-d89c-a1be-efff2dad0000</link>
      <description>It’s quite the downgrade for Callahan after failing in his lone season at the helm in Tennessee. Callahan will now work with second-year QB Jaxson Dart to develop his game following a promising rookie season in which he threw for 15 touchdowns and five interceptions over 14 games, while rushing for another nine scores. Hopefully Callahan’s total inability to develop Cam Ward in Tennessee isn’t a harbinger of things to come for Dart and the Giants.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Field Yates believes Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza is “ideal” for Klint Kubiak’s offensive system.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4d45-d042-afbc-7dd70b560000</link>
      <description>Mendoza is all but certain to land with the Raiders, who have the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. After displaying “elite accuracy and overall arm talent to throw to all levels of the field” during his final season at Indiana — leading the Hoosiers to the team’s first national title — Mendoza should be a good fir for Kubiak, fresh off turning Sam Darnold into a Super Bowl winning quarterback. “Mendoza brings a strong frame and in-pocket mobility with enough creativity to handle duress out of structure,” Yates said. “And his quick-processing skills point to a successful starting NFL QB.” Even if Mendoza struggles as a rookie, he will be a major upgrade for Brock Bowers and the rest of the Vegas pass catchers.</description>

      <title>Panthers hired former Dolphins quarterbacks coach Darrell Bevell as the team’s associate head coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4d7c-d89c-a1be-efff0a7a0000</link>
      <description>Bevell will operate as the Panthers’ new offensive specialist, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. Bevell, who was the pass game coordinator and QBs coach in Miami from 2022 to 2025, will reunite with Panthers head coach Dave Canales, the wide receivers coach for the Seahawks when Bevell was the team’s offensive coordinator. After bouncing around the league for the past 20 years, Bevell will look to maximize Bryce Young’s abilities in 2026 for a Carolina offense that last season ranked 26th in EPA per play and 18th in success rate.</description>

      <title>Packers named former Raiders offensive coordinator Luke Getsy as the team’s quarterbacks coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4db3-d89c-a1be-efffed0a0000</link>
      <description>Getsy makes his return to the Packers after offensive coordinator stints with the Bears and Raiders, both of which went terribly for Getsy and his quarterbacks. In Green Bay Getsy will work with Jordan Love, who in 2025 had the league’s second best adjusted drop back EPA and a top-five drop back success rate. The Packers QB room will likely be without Malik Willis, who is reportedly being pursued by the Dolphins and Cardinals.</description>

      <title>CBS Sports’ Matt Zenitz reports the Ravens are expected to hire former Broncos wide receivers coach Keary Colbert as their wide receivers coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4ddf-d042-afbc-7ddf1e3a0000</link>
      <description>Colbert was with the Broncos for three seasons. He previously coached in the college ranks, getting most of his experience at USC as a position coach and an assistant. Colbert will lead a receiver room headlined by Zay Flowers, who just went for a career-high 1,211 yards. The hope will be that Colbert can also get more out of Rashod Bateman, who logged a pitiful 224 yards and two scores in 2025.</description>

      <title>CBS Detroit’s Rachel Hopmeyer reports former Lions OT Dan Skipper will join the team’s coaching staff.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4e4b-d89c-a1be-efdf48f20000</link>
      <description>Unsurprisingly, Hopmeyer notes that Skipper will coach the offensive linemen in some capacity, though his official title hasn’t been announced. Detroit’s long-time sixth offensive lineman hung up the cleats after the 2025 season at the age of 31. It didn’t take him long to return to football, as Skipper volunteered to coach at the East-West Shrine Bowl right after the season. Now he will stay in Detroit as a staff member.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports the Seahawks are interviewing assistant offensive line coach Justin Outten for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4e5c-d355-a5bd-cf5ceb870000</link>
      <description>Outten is one of four internal candidates who will interview for the opening. Tight ends coach Mack Brown, pass game coordinator Jake Peetz, and quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko are the other three names. With one of those coaches getting promoted, another one or two will likely follow Klint Kubiak to Vegas. Per usual, the price to pay for winning the Super Bowl is a brain drain, which will primarily come on the offensive side of the ball for Seattle.</description>

      <title>Dolphins hired Eagles coach Kevin Patullo as their pass game coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4ebd-d042-afbc-7fff2c460000</link>
      <description>As NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero notes, Philly retained Patullo after demoting him from offensive coordinator. The uncomfortable arrangement was not long for this world and Patullo will now head to South Beach. Patullo served as the Eagles’ OC for one year. The team went from seventh in scoring in 2024 to 19th in Patullo’s lone season on the headset. Between Patullo and offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik, who was also fired as an OC at his last stop, the Dolphins are putting together an awfully underwhelming staff under first-time head coach Jeff Hafley.</description>

      <title>Falcons hired former Rams special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn as their assistant special teams coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4f03-d629-a1bc-ff1fdcb90000</link>
      <description>Blackburn was fired by the Rams towards the end of the regular season after several losses were influenced by blunders on special teams. He had been with the team since 2023 but poor special teams showings marked a rough ending to his tenure. Blackburn will get a fresh start as an assistant in the special teams room with the Rams.</description>
