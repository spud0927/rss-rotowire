      <title>Colts GM Chris Ballard said the team won’t trade Anthony Richardson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ec8b-dbe3-a9bb-fcdbb3f90000</link>
      <description>There’s probably not a huge market out there for quarterbacks who can’t hit 50 percent of their throws — maybe the Colts could have found the Trey Lance fourth-rounder — but this statement seems to say that the Colts will remain married to Richardson as their backup in 2025. Ballard said that he doesn’t feel Richardson is done in Indianapolis. Which, well, good luck with that.</description>

      <title>Dolphins claimed CB JuJu Brents off waivers from the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ec8d-d332-a1fd-febfb5fa0000</link>
      <description>It’s unclear if Brents, who missed time this offseason with a hamstring injury, is currently ready to play a big role in an NFL scheme. He posted a woeful 28.5 PFF coverage grade in a small sample of preseason snaps. His size and speed are hard to find and the Dolphins have a rough cornerback room, so we could see a big role for him in 2025, but he sure wouldn’t appear to be deserving of it being handed to him based on his first two seasons in the pros.</description>

      <title>Panthers claimed CB Damarri Mathis off waivers from the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ec89-db7b-a5dd-ec8d9f0a0000</link>
      <description>An 11-game starter as a rookie, Mathis saw his playing time reduced severely in 2024 as Riley Moss took over as Denver’s outside CB2 next to Patrick Surtain. He’s previously played for Panthers DC Ejiro Evero and could compete for playing time in Carolina. The Panthers also claimed WR Dalevon Campbell off waivers from the Chargers.</description>

      <title>Colts claimed LB Chad Muma off waivers from the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ec99-dbe3-a9bb-fcdbbdf00000</link>
      <description>Muma started just seven games in three years in Jacksonville, never really establishing himself as one of their best two inside linebackers. The Colts have a gaping hole at the position next to Zaire Franklin, though, and Muma could get a chance to secure that role in the final year of his rookie contract.</description>

      <title>Eagles claimed C Willie Lampkin off waivers from the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ec9b-de13-afdc-eedbc6370000</link>
      <description>Lampkin, who went undrafted, had terrific tape in Week 1’s preseason game against the Cowboys and went Reddit-viral for pancaking three different Cowboys en route to a 94.1 PFF grade with the backups. He’s a particularly short center at a list 5-foot-11, 290 pounds, which explains why he went undrafted despite an 85.6 PFF grade at North Carolina in his senior season. The Eagles seem to think the Rams were on to something here — perhaps Lampkin can crack their interior line at some point.</description>

      <title>Browns claimed RB Raheim Sanders off waivers from the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ec9e-dbe3-a9bb-fcdf5e4c0000</link>
      <description>He’ll slot in as the third back behind Dylan Sampson and Jerome Ford for the time being. The rookie 23-year-old had a 79.2 PFF pass block grade in 59 total snaps in the preseason and could eventually replace Ford as the third-down back — he was a strong possibility for the Chargers practice squad had he made it unclaimed. The Browns also claimed CB Jarrick Bernard-Converse off waivers from the Jets.</description>

      <title>Saints claimed WR Trey Palmer off waivers from the Buccaneers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-eca1-db7b-a5dd-eca5c2840000</link>
      <description>Palmer isn’t an immediate threat for a big role in New Orleans, but given how banged up Rashid Shaheed and Chris Olave have been in recent years, it’s not impossible that he eventually becomes fantasy-interesting. For the time being, Palmer likely won’t make the three-wide behind those two and Devaughn Vele. The Saints also claimed OL Xavier Truss off waivers from the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Panthers signed QB Hendon Hooker to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-eca9-de13-afdc-eeeb49d10000</link>
      <description>Hooker, the Lions third-rounder from 2023, couldn’t find a taker for his services on a 53-man roster so he’ll hop aboard the Panthers practice squad. Joining him there will be RB DeeJay Dallas, CB Kevin King, LB Krys Barnes, CB Shemar Bartholomew, OLB Boogie Basham, DE Jared Harrison-Hunte, OL Jarrett Kingston, LB Maz Mwansa, TE Bryce Pierre, WR Ja’seem Reed, CB Mike Reid, DT Sam Roberts, OT Mike Tarquin, S Trevian Thomas and OL Brandon Walton.</description>

      <title>Bills GM Brandon Beane said Tre’Davious White (leg) will play again this season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-eccf-de13-afdc-eecf034b0000</link>
      <description>He didn’t rule him out of Week 1, though that seems aggressive. Buffalo will be relying on pieces like Dorian Strong or Ja’Marcus Ingram to fill out the Week 1 depth chart at outside corner next to Christian Benford while White heals.</description>

      <title>Chiefs signed RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ecdb-db7b-a5dd-ecdfea7e0000</link>
      <description>It’s been done. He’ll be joined by QB Chris Oladokun, FB Carson Steele, WR Hal Presley, OT Chu Godrick, OL C.J. Hanson, DT Coziah Izzard, DT Brodric Martin, CB Melvin Smith Jr, CB Kevin Knowles and FS Mike Edwards.</description>
