      <title>Jonnu Smith caught both targets for 12 yards in the Steelers’ Week 15 win over the Dolphins, adding 14 yards and a touchdown on one carry.</title>

      <description>Smith scored the second of two rushing touchdowns by Pittsburgh tight ends, setting a new NFL record as the first team in history with two rushing scores by different tight ends in the same game. Leave it to Arthur Smith to be responsible for a record like that. Smith’s outing was otherwise far from noteworthy while playing in a four-man rotation at tight end for the Steelers, with all of Smith, Pat Freiermuth (three catches for 45 yards), Darnell Wshington (three catches for 25 yards), and Heyward (four carries for four yards and a touchdown) getting in on the action.</description>

      <title>Jets waived WR Allen Lazard.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2753-d1bc-a3fb-a77720380000</link>
      <description>The news was first reported by Pro Football Talk. Lazard will reportedly look to sign with a contender. We wish him luck in that endeavor. Lazard has 10 catches on 18 targets over ten games this season in a Jets offense that has been desperate for wideout production. He has been targeted on 13 percent of his pass routes through Week 15. Lazard could always land with longtime friend and former teammate Aaron Rodgers in Pittsburgh if the Steelers are looking to add more receiver depth ahead of the postseason. Jets beat writer Connor Hughes said Lazard had “questionable practice habits, and rubbed some teammates the wrong way with way he acted once Aaron Rodgers arrived” in 2023. Lazard’s departure from New York could open up more playing time for electric WR Isaiah Williams, who had six receptions for 53 yards last week against the Jaguars.</description>

      <title>Lamar Jackson said he’s “feeling better” after dealing with multiple injuries this season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-27eb-d005-a9bf-ffff4cd70000</link>
      <description>Jackson has appeared more like his normal, electric self over the past two weeks. In Week 15 against the Bengals Jackson threw for 150 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 26 yards. He appeared far more mobile and elusive than he did in the Ravens’ Thanksgiving night loss to the Bengals. “I believe I told you guys early on in the week that I was feeling better, like Thursday,” Jackson told reporters after Baltimore’s Week 15 win. “I guess you guys had to see it to believe it.” Apparently recovered from ankle and hamstring injuries he suffered this season, Jackson should be an excellent fantasy option in Week 16 against the Patriots in what could be a high-scoring affair.</description>

      <title>Commanders placed WR Noah Brown (ribs) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2802-d77b-adfb-ea83d9280000</link>
      <description>Brown’s 2025 season is over. He sustained the rib injury in Week 15 against the Giants on a 28-yard reception. Brown landed hard and needed help getting to the sideline. The oft-injured veteran ends the season with five catches for 83 yards over four games. Brown had spent time on IR earlier this season with a groin injury. He’s unlikely to remain with the Commanders in 2026.</description>

      <title>Rams TE Tyler Higbee (ankle) is eligible to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-280a-d005-a9bf-f83e00b10000</link>
      <description>The Athletic’s Nate Atkins said Higbee is unlikely to be active for Thursday night’s game against the Seahawks, however. Higbee has bee on IR since mid-November following a serious ankle injury against Seattle. His absence has opened up routes and targets for Colby Parkinson, who should be treated as a legit streaming option in Week 16. Parkinson and TE Terrance Ferguson led the Rams in pass routes last week against the Lions in an LA offense that uses two and three tight end sets at the NFL’s highest rate.</description>

      <title>Rams head coach Sean McVay said WR Davante Adams (hamstring) could be a game-time decision for Week 16 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-280d-d1bc-a3fb-ad2d44e80000</link>
      <description>McVay on Tuesday refused to rule out Adams following his apparently serious hamstring injury in Week 15’s win over the Lions. McVay acknowledged on Sunday night that Adams’ was in doubt for the Thursday night game, however. With almost no shot to suit up against Seattle, fantasy managers should make other plans at wideout for Week 16. The Rams are likely to be more run heavy with Adams sidelined, creating more touch-based upside for both Kyren Williams and Blake Corum.</description>

      <title>Rams RT Rob Havenstein (ankle) is eligible to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2847-d1bc-a3fb-ad6746870000</link>
      <description>Rams head coach Sean McVay said Havenstein remained unlikely to suit up for Thursday night’s matchup against the Seahawks. He would have a real shot to play in Week 17, however. Havenstein has dealt with ankle issues for much of the season and has been on IR since mid-November. He would be a needed addition to the Rams offensive line for the team’s postseason push.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter thinks “it will be a surprise” if Patrick Mahomes (knee) is not ready for the start of the 2026 season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2863-d005-a9bf-f877dcc90000</link>
      <description>Schefter cites the speed with which Mahomes got his torn ACL and LCL repaired — Monday, the day after it happened — as a major reason behind this. He also notes the timeline of nine months would put Mahomes in line to play in Week 2. “You know he’s going to have the absolute finest resources, care, attention, to bring him along,” Schefter continues. “He’s already set in to motion the chain of events that will bring him back sooner.” We wouldn’t be surprised if Mahomes is playing that early — see how quickly Joe Burrow came back this year from his turf toe against the initial diagnosis — but we also wouldn’t be surprised if Mahomes wasn’t quite the same player from the jump, especially as a scrambler, while he re-acclimates to what he can trust with his surgically-repaired knee.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Paul Dehner Jr. believes a potential firing for Bengals coach Zac Taylor “sounds very unlikely” right now.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2875-d1bc-a3fb-ad751d1b0000</link>
      <description>In news that will surprise nobody who is familiar with the Bengals organization, Dehner also writes that there “is zero thought” that GM Duke Tobin’s job is in jeopardy and that “the most likely scenario” is that DC Al Golden gets another year as well while the Bengals retool their defensive personnel. Perhaps you think that firing the main architects after a disappointing year is warranted. The Bengals reject your reality and substitute their own.</description>

      <title>Rams WR Puka Nacua, asked about Davante Adams (hamstring), said it will be “a great opportunity for all of the young guys and especially [Konata] Mumpfield.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-287d-d8cf-affb-bc7f3ee80000</link>
      <description>Nacua continued to say that Mumpfield “has been behind him and watching him and is someone we see as Tae’s apprentice.” While The Athletic’s Nate Atkins wouldn’t come out and directly say it, he did note that Mumpfield is “built most like Adams of the group at 6 feet 1, 185 pounds” and noted Mumpfield was the player that took on the majority of the snaps when Adams left Week 15’s game against the Lions. You probably don’t want to bank the fantasy playoffs on Mumpfield, but those in deeper leagues or playing the Thursday-only DFS contests may be interested in rolling the dice on the rookie seventh-round wideout.</description>
