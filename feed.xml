      <title>Commanders interviewed Steelers DC Teryl Austin for the same role.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ebf5-d56e-afff-effd6d110000</link>
      <description>You won’t find many defensive coordinators on the market more qualified than Austin, who has led as the Steelers’ defensive coordinator since 2022 while also holding the same role with the Lions (2014-2017) and the Bengals (2018). Since Austin took over as the Steelers’ defensive play-caller, the team finished in the top-10 in points allowed three times, while ranking in the top-15 in yards allowed twice. This is the first reported interview for Austin, who may or may not be back with the Steelers once they solidify their next head coach.</description>

      <title>Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said EDGE Harold Landry (knee) will not play in the AFC Championship game.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec1b-dc7a-af9b-efbf109c0000</link>
      <description>Landry didn’t practice all week and played just 11 snaps against the Texans. New England’s backup ends will once again be counted on to make some big splash pressures against the Broncos on Sunday. Landry’s status for the Super Bowl, should the Pats advance, would appear to be questionable.</description>

      <title>Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said WR Mack Hollins (abdomen/IR) and CB Carlton Davis (concussion protocol) are questionable for the AFC Championship game against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec1c-d35e-a1bf-eddef4920000</link>
      <description>Hollins was just designated to return yesterday, so we’d be a little surprised if he was instantly activated but this gives him a chance. Davis was spotted shedding a non-contact jersey in practice on Friday and would seem to have a real chance to go against Denver.</description>

      <title>Falcons completed an interview with Bears assistant GM Ian Cunningham for their general manager vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec1f-d968-a19b-fcff0cfe0000</link>
      <description>Cunningham is one of two candidates who are considered the favorites to land the Falcons’ general manager vacancy. Cunningham was hired as the Bears’ assistant general manager back in 2022 and has been on the radar as a potential GM hire for the last several seasons. The Bears’ success undoubtedly makes Cunningham the most attractive he’s ever been as a candidate, as the decision to pair head coach Ben Johnson with second-year quarterback Caleb Williams paid immediate dividends for the Bears, and the emergence of young talents like Colston Loveland and Luther Burden also make for good points. Whether it’s now or in the future, Cunningham’s days with the Bears could be numbered as he continues to generate interest.</description>

      <title>Seahawks activated TE Elijah Arroyo from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec3c-d35e-a1bf-edfe20ad0000</link>
      <description>He’ll play in the NFC Championship game, though his role might be small. Arroyo has been sidelined since Week 14 and hasn’t drawn more than two targets since Week 7’s win over the Texans. Perhaps the Seahawks will scheme up some downfield shots to him — the fact that they’re barely doing that with a healthy Rashid Shaheed probably makes Arroyo a stay-away in DFS contests this weekend.</description>

      <title>Seahawks activated George Holani (hamstring) off injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec3f-dc7a-af9b-efbf069c0000</link>
      <description>Holani will likely see RB2 reps — at least some of them — behind Kenneth Walker against the Rams on Sunday. He’ll be an interesting DFS punt. Velus Jones and Cam Akers are also on the roster, and one of them will probably be inactive on Sunday if Holani is up.</description>

      <title>Rams EDGE Byron Young (knee) is questionable to play in the NFC Championship Game against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec42-d35e-a1bf-edc2d9f00000</link>
      <description>Rams head coach Sean McVay said the team fully expects Young to play on Sunday. That is great news. Young is up to 56 tackles, 74 quarterback pressures and a team-high 13 sacks this season. Although he has banked six quarterback pressures in two games against the Seahawks this season, he has not yet recorded a sack against them.</description>

      <title>Miami Herald’s Barry Jackson believes the Dolphins “almost assuredly” will release Tyreek Hill before mid-March.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec4d-d968-a19b-fcfd41070000</link>
      <description>The Dolphins are over the cap before they even get into what it would take to release Tua Tagovailoa off the books. Hill has a $51.1 million cap number for 2026 and the Dolphins can save at least $23 million in cap space depending on what designation they would decide to use to release Hill’s contract. He has a $11 million guarantee set to activate in mid-March as well as a $5 million roster bonus. Hill, entering his age-32 season after tearing a number of ligaments in his knee, would be a fascinating free agent. Perhaps even an affordable one for a contender.</description>

      <title>Chicago Tribune’s Brad Biggs believes the Bears wouldn’t get “a whole lot back in return” in a potential DJ Moore trade.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec55-d56e-afff-eefd41190000</link>
      <description>The Bears wouldn’t save any real money by releasing Moore because of the way his contract is structured. They could realize $16.5 million in cap space if they traded Moore, but the acquiring team would be taking on a major cap hit to acquire the soon-to-be 29-year-old receiver. It’s possible that the three sides could agree to a new contract before sending Moore out to a new team (our speculation, not Biggs’), but those negotiations always sound easier than they actually are. Moore will be a key domino for the Bears this offseason whether he stays or goes, and it sounds like there’s at least a chance Chicago moves on.</description>

      <title>Rams ruled out RT Rob Havenstein (ankle) for Los Angeles’ NFL Championship Game against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ec4a-d56e-afff-eeeabdb50000</link>
      <description>Darn. The Rams opened Havenstein’s practice window this week, but he will not play on Sunday in Seattle. Havenstein is a capable run blocker, and the Seahawks allow a league-low 3.8 yards per carry. Fortunately, his backup, OT Warren McClendon, has been playing very well in his stead.</description>
