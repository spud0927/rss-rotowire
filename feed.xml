      <title>Dalton Kincaid caught all six targets for 108 yards in the Bills’ Week 5 loss to the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b7bf-d6e9-af9d-bfbf1bb70000</link>
      <description>Kincaid broke the century mark for the first time in his career, more than doubling up the nearest Buffalo pass-catcher in the process. Two first half turnovers allowed the Patriots to clamp down on the run, in turn forcing the Bills into a more one-dimensional offensive approach that focused on hitting the intermediate areas of the middle of the field through the air. Those variables led to the career night for the third-year tight end, who continually found space behind a linebacker unit that played close to the line of scrimmage throughout. Kincaid might find less room to operate against the Falcons in Week 6.</description>

      <title>Khalil Shakir caught 6-of-9 targets for 45 yards in the Bills’ Week 5 loss to the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b7c2-deb6-a7fd-f7dfa58b0000</link>
      <description>Shakir quickly became quarterback Josh Allen’s top target on a night the Patriots effectively removed the run game. The counter to New England’s linebacker unit playing so close to the line of scrimmage was tight end Dalton Kincaid, who went for a career-high 108 yards in the loss. The short-area nature of Shakir’s targets were not enough to return a usable fantasy outing, something he will look to rectify when the Bills take on the Falcons on Monday Night Football in Week 6.</description>

      <title>Keon Coleman caught 4-of-7 targets for 23 yards and a touchdown in the Bills’ Week 5 loss to the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b7c5-deb6-a7fd-f7df4f710000</link>
      <description>Coleman routinely matched up against the top coverage corner from the Patriots in Christian Gonzalez, whose coverage all but eliminated Coleman from the game plan. A second-half touchdown brought the Bills within three points and he narrowly missed adding a second on the following possession, with Gonzalez able to leverage the back of the end zone to ensure Coleman didn’t get both feet down in the field of play. The modest fantasy outing now marks four consecutive games with four or fewer receptions after his Week 1 eruption, making Coleman nothing more than a touchdown-dependent FLEX option moving forward.</description>

      <title>Joshua Palmer caught both targets for 36 yards in the Bills’ Week 5 loss to the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b7c9-d95b-addb-ffcf47ea0000</link>
      <description>Palmer ranked behind Keon Coleman, Khalil Shakir, Dalton Kincaid, and Dawson Knox in offensive snaps played this season and has now gone four straight games with two or fewer receptions after his five-catch outing in Week 1. That leaves him unworthy of weekly fantasy consideration, until further notice.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Xavier Worthy (shoulder/ankle) “is expected to go” for Week 5 against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b97c-de31-a999-bdfe32150000</link>
      <description>According to Rapoport, the Chiefs’ decision to place Worthy on their injury report was more out of precaution. He then added that the second-year receiver “is fine” and should be good to go for Monday night’s game against the Jaguars. Despite the optimism to start the morning, fantasy managers will still want to check the Chiefs inactives 90 minutes before kickoff to ensure Worthy is officially in the clear for tonight’s tilt with the Jaguars.</description>

      <title>Bengals HC Zac Taylor said “it’s a very fair question after the turnovers that we had” when asked if he still believes in Jake Browning as the QB1.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b9a1-db72-a199-fbeb23610000</link>
      <description>The question about Taylor’s belief in Browning came following Taylor’s postgame remarks in which he said the team will “look at all personnel to make sure we’re doing the right thing.” Browning hasn’t been great in place of Joe Burrow. The backup has done most of his stat padding in meaningless garbage time, but the options behind him, which include journeymen Brett Rypien and Mike White, are unlikely to be much better. This felt like an inevitable problem the Bengals would face the moment Burrow (toe) went down in Week 2, but the Bengals’ offense has imploded in quick fashion. Since Week 3, the Bengals rank last in EPA per play, 31st in dropback success rate, and 29th in offensive success rate. It’s not good, folks. We’ll see if a change comes down the line, but as far as fantasy is concerned, Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins will be more inconsistent than usual no matter who is starting next week.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Rich Cimini reports Jets LB Jermaine Johnson (ankle) will travel with the team to London for Week 6 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b9b1-db72-a199-fbfb802b0000</link>
      <description>Johnson isn’t a lock to play in Week 6, but the Jets will give him a chance to suit up by letting him travel to London. Johnson hasn’t played since Week 2 and was a DNP all week ahead of Week 5’s game against the Cowboys. Johnson should still be considered a long shot to play until we see how he fares this week in practice. In addition to Johnson, the Jets will also have RB/KR Kene Nwangwu (hamstring) travel to London in hopes of suiting up next week.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Omarion Hampton (ankle) will undergo more testing to determine the severity of his injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b9ea-dd4c-afb9-ffebb5200000</link>
      <description>Hampton is at risk of missing some time after being spotted in a walking boot following Week 5’s loss to the Commanders, but we could have a better sense of his return timeline once we know more about the severity of his injury. Any length of absence would be tough for a Chargers team that has been dealt long-term injuries to several key offensive players already, including Najee Harris, whose season ended in Week 3 due to a torn Achilles. We’ll hopefully have more information on Hampton soon, but if he were to miss any time, the Chargers would be looking at Kimani Vidal and Hassan Haskins as their top two backs heading into Week 6 against the Dolphins.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports it’s “more likely than not” that Travon Walker (wrist) will miss Week 5 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ba22-d94a-a79d-bb2fe8920000</link>
      <description>Walker underwent surgery on his wrist last week. While the star pass rusher is not expected to be out long-term, a one-game absence was always the most likely outcome. According to Rapoport, the Jaguars will allow Walker to decide how he feels before game time, but added that Walker seems like a “long shot” to play at this point. Walker has totaled 12 tackles, two TFLs, and two sacks in four games this season.</description>

      <title>Packers designated WR Christian Watson (knee) for return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ba2d-def2-abdb-bf6d4c980000</link>
      <description>Watson was on the practice field Monday, marking his first practice since tearing his ACL in Week 18 of last season. The Packers now have 21 days to activate Watson from injured reserve, and given the nature of his injury and his extended time away, it wouldn’t be surprising if they used every day available to them to ramp Watson up before his return. The fourth-year receiver caught 29 passes for 620 yards and two touchdowns in 15 games last season while seeing just 53 targets. He’ll help add another deep element to Green Bay’s passing attack, but Watson has been very boom-or-bust for fantasy managers for much of his career.</description>
