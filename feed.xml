      <title>Colts signed CB Xavien Howard to a one-year contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bd58-df63-a199-fd7b14c60000</link>
      <description>Per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Howard can earn up to $5 million on his deal. Howard has spent the entirety of his eight-year career with the Dolphins, but was released in March 2024. He remained unsigned throughout the year despite having interest in joining both the Texans and Bengals. The veteran corner will be 32 at the start of this season and earned a PFF coverage grade of 51.9 in his last season of action, allowing opposing receivers to go for 44-502-2 on 71 targets while playing on 475 coverage snaps. It’s hard to imagine this is anything more than a depth signing at this time, but Howard brings a wealth of experience to the Colts’ secondary and spent two years playing under defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo.</description>

      <title>Patriots Executive VP of Player Personnel Eliot Wolf said the team would be willing to trade away a first or second round pick if it was “best for the team.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bda7-d90d-a5bd-bfff36030000</link>
      <description>Interestingly, a high draft pick is part of what would be required to facilitate a trade with the Bengals to land star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson. Wolf also said the team would “absolutely” be open to making a big trade before the start of the season. Who Wolf could have in mind while making these statements is anybody’s guess, but these quotes come less than 24 hours after we learned the Bengals are open to talking to teams about a potential trade for Hendrickson. The Patriots are one of a handful of teams that could have the cap space to get a deal done with Hendrickson. They $59.798 million in available cap space, which leads the league by a wide margin. They would need to figure out a player or two to give back to the Bengals in a deal, but the Patriots are officially a team to watch in the coming days as a suitor for Hendrickson.</description>

      <title>Falcons released WR DJ Chark.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bdb0-df63-a199-fdbbdd750000</link>
      <description>The Falcons signed Chark in late July and are now parting ways with him after nearly a month. The veteran receiver totaled 31 receiving yards and one touchdown last season with the Chargers and has struggled to replicate the success he enjoyed in 2019 when he broke out for 73-1008-8. Now an official journeyman of the league, Chark will be looking for his fifth team in four seasons. In addition to releasing Chark, the Falcons also waived/injured QB Emory Jones (concussion) and signed QB Ben DiNucci.</description>

      <title>Patriots Executive VP of Player Personnel Eliot Wolf said Stefon Diggs is “ahead of schedule injury wise.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bdb8-d90d-a5bd-bffb96520000</link>
      <description>Wolf isn’t exactly breaking news here. Diggs was cleared for full participation to start training camp and hasn’t suffered any reported setbacks. The veteran receiver is making his way back from a torn ACL he suffered in Week 8 of last season, and is presumably on track to be ready for Week 1. Wolf said last month that Diggs does not look limited in practice, which is another encouraging sign for his return. We’ll get a better sense of Diggs’ availability once final roster cutdowns take place next week, but he’s been trending in the right direction for months.</description>

      <title>Jordan Love (thumb) returned to practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bdcf-d45c-a7fc-bfdfb52f0000</link>
      <description>Love underwent surgery to correct a ligament issue on his non-throwing hand, but was away for less than a week. The Packers’ QB1 was sporting a glove on his hand, but appears to be on track to be ready for Week 1 when the Packers play host to the Lions. Love finished as the QB20 in fantasy points per game last season and had only six top-12 weeks. He’ll profile most weeks as a mid QB2 in an offense that’s expected to feature plenty of Josh Jacobs after leading the league with a 53 percent neutral rush rate last season.</description>

      <title>Matthew Stafford (back) returned to practice on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-be01-d45c-a7fc-be1b98ce0000</link>
      <description>Our national nightmare is over. After refusing on Saturday to say if Stafford worked out as planned, the Rams’ QB1 took to the field in full pads and jersey on Monday, looking ready for his first taste of training camp practice. Stafford has been dealing with a back injury for weeks and, at one point, had an epidural to help with the pain. Stafford has endured numerous injuries throughout his 16-year career, including multiple back injuries. Head coach Sean McVay said last week that part of Stafford’s absence last week was due to function and pain tolerance, which doesn’t seem great. The Rams are going to do what they can to have Stafford ready for the season, but we wouldn’t assume he’s a lock to start Week 1 until we see how he progresses in the coming weeks. If he’s unable to go at any point in the season, Jimmy Garoppolo would take the reins at QB1.</description>

      <title>Rhamondre Stevenson (undisclosed) was spotted in a non-contact jersey on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-be13-df63-a199-ff3bf58d0000</link>
      <description>It’s an upgrade from last week, when Stevenson was completely sidelined in practice. Stevenson is dealing with an undisclosed injury that was first announced last Tuesday, but could be trending toward a full return by the end of the week. The fifth-year back could be on the wrong side of a split backfield after rookie TreVeyon Henderson has impressed through two preseason games, rushing for 5-38-1 while also returning a kick return for a 100-yard score. We’ll be sure to provide any updates on Stevenson’s availability as they are announced.</description>

      <title>Browns named Joe Flacco as the starting QB for Week 1 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-be20-df63-a199-ff2bf77d0000</link>
      <description>This comes to the surprise of nobody. The Browns opened camp with what was announced as a four-way quarterback competition, but Kenny Pickett, rookie third-rounder Dillon Gabriel, and rookie fifth-rounder Shedeur Sanders never stood much of a chance at unseating the 40-year-old signal-caller. Flacco led the Browns to a playoff appearance in 2023 when he threw for 1,616-13-8 in five starts on his way to winning AP Comeback Player of the Year. Last season with the Colts, Flacco threw for 1,781-12-7 in eight games, proving again to be prone to turnovers while playing more loosely and freely than in his days in Baltimore. While Flacco will open the season as the Browns’ starter, we would expect to see a few different starters under center before the season is up. He’ll profile a mid-QB2 against the Bengals in what could be a high-scoring affair.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports free agent WR Gabe Davis is scheduled to meet for a second time with the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-be38-d45c-a7fc-be3ab1f70000</link>
      <description>Davis met with the Steelers in early June but left without a deal. The former Jaguar was released this offseason with a failed physical designation and has been looking for work all offseason. In one season with the Jags, Davis caught 20-of-42 targets for 239 yards and two touchdowns and saw his season cut short by a torn meniscus. The Steelers have a need for an outside receiver opposite DK Metcalf, but it’s fair to wonder how much Davis has to offer after being released one year into a three-year, $39 million contract.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Browns and RB Quinshon Judkins have been unable to agree to a deal despite the criminal charges against Judkins being dismissed.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-be43-d45c-a7fc-be5bd3430000</link>
      <description>The NFL still plans to run its own investigation into Judkins and the domestic battery charges that led to his arrest in July. The police report that followed Judkins’ arrest said “bruising was clearly evident” on the woman he allegedly assaulted, which undoubtedly complicates the Browns’ decision to sign him even if he won’t be charged in court. We’ll see if a deal can be reached before the start of the season, but it wouldn’t be surprising if a decision is put off until the league concludes its investigation.</description>
