      <title>Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander reports that support for C.J. Stroud “remains strong inside the organization.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a131-d042-afbc-fdf3c08f0000</link>
      <description>He adds that the Texans will engage in talks with Stroud’s representation “at some point” about a long-term contract, the expectation is that any potential long-term extension wouldn’t get done this offseason. It’s sensible for the Texans to not get out ahead of the Stroud talks after last year’s playoff flatlining. It’s also sensible for the Texans to look at all 52 games that he’s played, rather than just his last two, when thinking about what they expect from him going forward. The Texans will try to build up around Stroud ahead of the last two years of his rookie contract to see what they can get out of him, and Alexander believes an improved running game should also take some of the pressure off of him.</description>

      <title>Ravens head coach Jesse Minter said “I don’t know that he needs to run more, I actually think there’s times where he can run less” when asked about Lamar Jackson running more.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a161-d89c-a1be-affff5e00000</link>
      <description>There’s an element of this answer that nods to an ideal world, because the times where he can run less are based on “if you build an offense that takes advantage of the under center, the downhill run game. Now that opens up a lot of boots and play actions.” But it’s not what fantasy football managers want to hear after last season’s scant 67/349/2 line while struggling through injuries. Entering his age-29 season, it wouldn’t be surprising if Jackson’s game evolved. It certainly sounds like his head coach would rather it evolve than not.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Alaina Getzenberg believes Khalil Shakir is “likely taking on a bigger role” in 2026.</title>

      <description>Joe Brady said he was one of the team’s best football players and said that there are other ways to get the ball in his hands than just in the screen game. We’re not sure how seriously to take this at the combine, before the Bills bring in what the actual competition will be — we don’t think Shakir is going to take on a bigger role if A.J. Brown or D.J. Moore show up — but it’s at least worthwhile to note that Brady loves Shakir and he seems ticketed to have a major role in the passing offense in 2026.</description>

      <title>Packers did not tender restricted free agent RB Emanuel Wilson, making him a free agent</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a1ea-dbf6-abdd-effb7b1e0000</link>
      <description>This is a calculated ploy by the Packers, but we’re still a little surprised they did this after Wilson rushed for 496 yards on 125 carries and generally played as a pretty good backup runner. It leaves MarShawn Lloyd and Chris Brooks as backups behind Josh Jacobs. Wilson turns 27 in May and should be able to find work elsewhere if he doesn’t wind up back with the Packers.</description>

      <title>Raiders hired former Titans offensive coordinator Nick Holz as their passing game coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a1ef-d629-a1bc-b1ff61090000</link>
      <description>Holz returns to where he started as an NFL coach. He was Titans OC for two years before Brian Callahan’s regime went down, and also has passing game coordinator experience with the Jaguars in 2023.</description>

      <title>Cowboys will restructure contracts of QB Dak Prescott, WR CeeDee Lamb and OG Tyler Smith, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a490-d89c-a1be-afdf7d790000</link>
      <description>Restructuring the contracts of Prescott, Lamb and Smith will create $66 million in cap space. Schefter also passes along that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of DTs Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With the new cap set at $301.2 million, the Cowboys had negative-$56.1 million in cap space. These moves help Dallas become compliant and have money to work with this offseason.</description>

      <title>The Patriots have explored a trade for WR A.J. Brown, but feel the Eagles’ asking price is unserious, according to the Boston Herald’s Andrew Callahan.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a52c-d89c-a1be-afff5fe00000</link>
      <description>The Patriots are an obvious fit for Brown, who was previously coached by Mike Vrabel in Tennessee. New England also has the need for another offensive weapon and cap space to take on a contract as large as Brown’s. According to a previous report by the Athletic’s Chad Graff, the Patriots will be active in trade talks for Brown, though they could be reluctant to give up their first-round pick. It’s difficult to imagine the Eagles moving Brown without receiving top draft capital in return. Brown is one of the biggest offseason dominos yet to fall, though a resolution should be expected ahead of the legal tampering period.</description>

      <title>Notre Dame RB Jeremiyah Love ran an official 4.36 40-yard dash on his second run at the 2026 NFL Combine.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a576-d042-afbc-fdf6b2a20000</link>
      <description>It’s a blistering time for the running back prospect that came into the Combine expected to clock the fastest run. There is an interesting dynamic to this year’s free agency and draft in that there is no shortage of viable options with available veterans, meaning we could see rookie backs fall more in the draft than in recent years. Either way, Love is doing his part to bolster his draft capital ahead of April’s NFL Draft, and he could have just solidified his case as the favorite to be the first back off the board.</description>

      <title>Mike Washington Jr. ran an official 4.33 40-yard dash at the 2026 NFL Combine.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a595-d629-a1bc-b59dae580000</link>
      <description>Not only did that give Washington the fastest time amongst running backs, but he did so at 6' 1", 223 pounds, giving him a 99th percentile weight-adjusted 40 time. There have been questions about his draft profile throughout the process this offseason, but his weight-adjusted speed score alone could catapult him up draft boards in the coming months ahead of the NFL Draft in April. He did his part to help his case on Saturday.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jenna Laine reports the Bucs will “aggressively pursue” Mike Evans in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a59a-d042-afbc-fddaef7d0000</link>
      <description>Bucs officials met with Evans’ representation at the NFL Combine and appear ready to make an all-out push to bring back the veteran for 2026. Evans, entering his age-33 season, said this month he would return for a 13th NFL season, but declined to say where he might play. Evans in 2025 struggled through injuries, including a collar bones injury, catching 30 passes for 368 yards and three touchdowns while missing nine games. He posted the second lowest receiving success rate of his storied NFL career. Evans would be a good fit for multiple contenders, including the wideout-needy Patriots and Bills.</description>
