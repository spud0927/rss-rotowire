      <title>Cowboys RB Javonte Williams (shoulder/neck) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bb2-d35e-a1bf-7ff26b9a0000</link>
      <description>Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer told reporters early on Wednesday that both Williams and RB Malik Davis (calf/eye) would be limited. Instead, the team listed both players with DNPs yesterday and today. Rookie RB Jaydon Blue could see a fantasy-friendly workload this week against the Giants.</description>

      <title>Cowboys TE Jake Ferguson (calf) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bb9-dc7a-af9b-ffbf3eaa0000</link>
      <description>Ferguson aggravated his old calf injury during his team’s Week 17 game and was unable to practice yesterday. He now has a chance to play in Week 18. Whether the Cowboys allow him to play is a separate issue. The 26-year-old tight end is under contract through 2029.</description>

      <title>49ers TE George Kittle (ankle) is questionable to play in Week 18 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bb7-d35e-a1bf-7ff7c9e40000</link>
      <description>Kittle remained limited throughout all three practices this week. We expect him to play through the ankle injury in a winner-take-all matchup against the Seahawks. While both teams are playoff-bound, the winner claims the NFC West title and the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Kittle is an elite TE1.</description>

      <title>Seahawks WR Rashid Shaheed (concussion) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 18 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bbd-dc7a-af9b-ffbffce10000</link>
      <description>Shaheed suffered a concussion in Week 17, but kicked off Week 18 practices with a limited session on Tuesday. He upgraded to full on Wednesday and continued practicing fully today. The Seahawks’ speedy receiver and return specialist could rip off a few long gains this week against the 49ers’ fantasy-friendly defense.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) is questionable to play in Week 18 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bc0-d35e-a1bf-7fc2d14c0000</link>
      <description>Pearsall is on track after logging three consecutive limited practice sessions this week. He played through the pain last week, meeting with team trainers at times along the sideline. Despite the injuries, he caught 5-of-8 targets for 85 yards. Pearsall is a WR3 with big-play upside against the Seahawks’ top-tier defense this week.</description>

      <title>49ers LT Trent Williams (hamstring) is questionable to play in Week 18 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bb2-d56e-afff-fffa73440000</link>
      <description>The 37-year-old Williams suffered his first career hamstring injury, running 17.6 miles per hour on the 49ers’ first play from scrimmage last week. He was entirely unable to practice, but we expect him to give it a go in pre-game warmups.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bb2-d56e-afff-fffa73440000</guid>

      <title>The Seahawks ruled out LT Charles Cross (hamstring) for Week 18 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bd5-d35e-a1bf-7fd7da210000</link>
      <description>Cross was unable to resume practicing this week, theoretically leaving OL Josh Jones (knee/ankle) as the team’s fill-in starter. Unfortunately, Jones is questionable to play this week, though he reportedly “just got banged up” in Week 17 and is expected to play.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports that the Dolphins hired “Hall-of-Fame QB and ESPN analyst Troy Aikman as a consultant” to assist in the team’s search for a new general manager.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7bd8-d35e-a1bf-7fda95110000</link>
      <description>This “is not a permanent role” for Aikman. He is expected to continue providing insights for ESPN. Per Schefter, the Dolphins’ ownership wants “an outside respected perspective from someone who had strong relationships across the league.” That latter part could be key. Aikman is undoubtedly plugged into multiple front offices and may be able to help the Dolphins identify an up-and-comer from another personnel department.</description>

      <title>Rams RB Kyren Williams (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7be6-d35e-a1bf-7fe6c1210000</link>
      <description>Williams’ backup, RB Blake Corum (ankle), has not yet practiced this week and the Rams are already headed to the playoffs. Rams rookie RB Jarquez Hunter could see live action this week against the Cardinals, if the coaching staff opts to preserve Williams’ health for the postseason.</description>

      <title>Rams RB Blake Corum (ankle) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7be6-dc7a-af9b-ffffca280000</link>
      <description>Corum is firmly on the wrong side of questionable at this point and the Rams have already secured a playoff spot. Starting RB Kyren Williams (ankle) is nursing an ankle injury. If both players are declared inactive, rookie RB Jarquez Hunter could get the start.</description>
