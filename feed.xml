      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports D’Andre Swift (groin, questionable) is expected to play against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-66b1-d713-ad9e-6ef552e40000</link>
      <description>Swift missed Friday’s practice with a personal issue after practicing in full on Thursday, but it would appear he’s good to go after his lingering groin issue finally cost him a game in Week 9. The problem for Swift and his fantasy managers is that Kyle Monangai, who had already been pushing close to 50 percent of the Bears’ snaps, went off in his absence. This could be a much more evenly split backfield going forward, especially if Swift is not 100 percent healthy. Then again, maybe Swift will immediately resume his normal role. Both backs find themselves inside the top 30 for Week 10.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Harold Fannin Jr. (hamstring, questionable) is “expected to play” against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-66b5-d45b-affe-77b7d9430000</link>
      <description>Fannin was a genuine question mark after missing Thursday’s session, but his limited Friday session seems to have gotten him back on track. The problem is, David Njoku is also playing, and this is a Browns offense that is going to want to ride the running game in Quinshon Judkins’ return. All that is conspiring to make Fannin more of a TE2 than TE1 for Week 10.</description>

      <title>Falcons declared CB Mike Hughes, S Jordan Fuller, EDGE Leonard Floyd, OL Andrew Stueber, OG Matthew Bergeron, OL Joshua Gray, and DL LaCale London inactive for Week 10 against the Colts.</title>

      <description>Hughes was one of two players on Atlanta with a questionable designation. He will miss Week 10’s game with a neck injury. Right guard Chris Lindstrom is active despite dealing with a foot issue.</description>

      <title>Colts declared RB DJ Giddens, EDGE Samson Ebukam, WR Anthony Goul, EDGE Tyquan Lewis, S Reuben Lowery, TE Will Mallory, and OT Luke Tenuta inactive for Week 10 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-68bf-d673-a39e-ecbf142c0000</link>
      <description>The Colts’ notable injury-related absence is defensive tackle DeForest Buckner. He was placed on injured reserve earlier this week. DJ Giddens remains a healthy scratch for this game.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Garrett Wilson (knee) is expected to play in Week 10 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-68c6-d1e7-a1fa-7aeea7000000</link>
      <description>The news doesn’t come as much of a surprise. Wilson was listed as questionable on Friday after a full practice. Coming off the bye week, he was always expected to return for today’s game. Having seen at least eight targets in every game this year, Wilson is stepping right back into the WR1 ranks for his Week 10 date with the Browns.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Cedric Tillman (hamstring) is expected to play in Week 10 against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-68c9-d713-ad9e-6cdd3f670000</link>
      <description>Tillman was listed as questionable after being activated from injured reserve over the weekend. The questionable tag was largely a procedural matter. Tillman will return to a Browns offense helmed by Dillon Gabriel. The rookie hasn’t found much success this year. He has been at his best when checking the ball down to his tight ends. Tillman should remain on fantasy benches for at least one more week to develop some chemistry with Gabriel.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Tetairoa McMillan (hamstring) is expected to play in Week 10 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-68cc-d673-a39e-ecdd0c1f0000</link>
      <description>McMillan was a late addition to the injury report, popping up as a limited participant before being listed as questionable. The rookie seemingly suffered the injury during the final practice of the week, putting his availability for today’s game in jeopardy. The good news is that he is expected to be out there. Fantasy managers, however, should still be wary that he looks as great as usual and gets a full-time role. McMillan is normally a locked-in WR2. He will move to the WR2/3 border for Week 10.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “the Chiefs made a late strong push to acquire Seahawks linebacker Boye Mafe.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-68cf-d673-a39e-ecdf57f10000</link>
      <description>Schefter noted that one of his sources believed the deal was complete. Seattle ultimately chose to hang onto Mafe at the deadline. Mafe had 15 sacks between the 2023 and 2024 seasons. He does not have a sack this year and his playing time has dipped in back-to-back seasons. Even in the midst of a downswing, Mafe is worth more to a contending Seahawks team than future draft picks.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Cooper Kupp (hamstring) has “a chance” of playing in Week 10 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-68d3-d45b-affe-7dd7674b0000</link>
      <description>Rapoport said Kupp has a better chance of playing this week than he did in Week 9. He was also listed as questionable last week but didn’t appear awfully close to suiting up over the weekend and was ruled out ahead of kickoff. Rapoport called his status “up in the air” for today’s game. With Tory Horton listed as doubtful, Rashid Shaheed could be the team’s No. 2 receiver for his first game in Seattle if Kupp isn’t active. Fantasy managers should avoid the WR2 situation on the Seahawks if Kupp is active.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports the Bills offered the Dolphins a 2027 first-round pick as part of a package for Jaylen Waddle.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-68e1-d1e7-a1fa-7aebcc7d0000</link>
      <description>Pelissero mentioned a 2026 third-round pick as part of the deal as well. Buffalo reportedly made the highest offer for Waddle, but the Dolphins turned away all callers and held onto their star wideout. The Dolphins view Waddle as part of their future, even if they are forced to make changes at head coach and quarterback. It sounds like there was almost no price a team could have paid to pry him away from Miami.</description>
