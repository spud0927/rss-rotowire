      <title>Bucs WR Sterling Shepard (foot) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 5 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ac08-d6e9-af9d-ae98ae250000</link>
      <description>Shepard was listed as a DNP for Wednesday’s walkthrough but returned for two full practices to close the week. It was just a maintenance day for the veteran wideout. With Chris Godwin back in the lineup last week, Shepard’s role was reduced and he was targeted just four times. He is nothing more than a WR5/6 heading into Week 5.</description>

      <title>Colts coach Shane Steichen is uncertain if Adonai Mitchell will dress for Week 5 against the Raiders after his Week 4 miscues.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ac0b-d6e9-af9d-ae9bca6a0000</link>
      <description>“Working through that,” was Steichen’s Friday update. It must be said, Steichen’s quote was delivered before Alec Pierce (concussion) was again ruled out. Mitchell probably “has” to play, but it’s clear the team isn’t just moving on from his Week 4 mistakes that cost Indy two long touchdowns. If Mitchell suits up, it could only be on an emergency basis behind Ashton Dulin.</description>

      <title>Seahawks DB Devon Witherspoon (knee) has been ruled out for Week 5 against the Bucs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-ac14-deb6-a7fd-ffdf70ad0000</link>
      <description>The same is true of FS Julian Love (hamstring) and EDGE DeMarcus Lawrence (quad). Seattle’s banged up defense is a break for the Bucs’ equally-injured offense. The Hawks’ primary slot corner, Witherspoon hasn’t played since Week 1.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports Eagles wide receivers A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith are frustrated with their roles in the offense.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-afb0-d6e9-af9d-afb02c1b0000</link>
      <description>You didn’t need a paid subscription to the Athletic to figure out Brown was unhappy this year, he made that clear in the postgame press briefing after totaling seven yards on nine targets in Week 4. Smith hasn’t been as vocal, but his underwhelming numbers this year have come on even less targets (20) than Brown has received (28). The Eagles are 4-0 and there’s been no indication Philadelphia intends to lean more towards the pass going forward. They face the Broncos’ top secondary in Week 5.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Ravens RB Keaton Mitchell will be active for Week 5 against the Texans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-afb8-d6e9-af9d-afb83e350000</link>
      <description>Mitchell impressed in the preseason with reports that he solidified himself as the No. 3 back in the Ravens’ offense. Once the season began, coach John Harbaugh made it clear that wasn’t a valued role as Mitchell was deemed a healthy scratch since the opening week. With Lamar Jackson sidelined for Week 5 and the Ravens turning to Cooper Rush, Mitchell is going to be active and could provide a spark in Lamar’s absence. He still doesn’t have much fantasy value as a contingent back or otherwise.</description>

      <title>Steelers WR Calvin Austin (shoulder) could potentially miss multiple games.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b0b8-deb6-a7fd-f3ff57710000</link>
      <description>Austin’s injury required a stay in the hospital, with the only update passed by the team being that his X-Rays came back clean. Even so, the team labeled him “week-to-week” as they catch their breath on bye in Week 5, meaning he could be facing a multi-game absence starting in Week 6 against the Browns. Roman Wilson, Scotty Miller, and Ben Skowronek could all be tasked with increased roles in his absence.</description>

      <title>Saints QB/TE Taysom Hill (knee) is expected to play in Week 5 and “have a role.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b0bb-deb6-a7fd-f3ffd11c0000</link>
      <description>This comes from Saints Beat Reporter Nick Underhill via X. It remains unclear what that role will be, although Underhill speculates that the team could look to get the veteran involved at both quarterback and tight end. Juwan Johnson is questionable with an ankle injury while Foster Moreau has yet to be activated from the PUP list, potentially opening up additional room for Hill to serve as a quasi-tight end against the Giants.</description>

      <title>Titans activated RB Tyjae Spears (ankle) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b0c1-d6e9-af9d-bad169410000</link>
      <description>The move sets the stage for Spears to make his season debut against the Cardinals in Week 5, although he continues to be listed questionable by the team. Fantasy managers likely have better options available than a committee back coming off injury.</description>

      <title>Raiders downgraded TE Michael Mayer (concussion) to out for Week 5 against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b0c3-d95b-addb-f8c7fe530000</link>
      <description>Fellow tight end Brock Bowers is listed as questionable after going limited-DNP-DNP in practice this week, potentially leaving veteran Ian Thomas in line to operate as the featured tight end against the Colts. Fantasy managers will want to track the situation through inactives 90-minutes prior to the team’s afternoon kickoff.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b0c3-d95b-addb-f8c7fe530000</guid>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee) is “trending toward not playing” in Week 5 against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-b0c6-d95b-addb-f8c6fc300000</link>
      <description>Fellow tight end Michael Mayer was ruled out Saturday, potentially leaving the position in the hands of veteran Ian Thomas. The team elevated Albert Okwuegbunam. Fantasy managers in a bind could do worse than adding Thomas for a spot start considering expected game flow against the Colts.</description>
