      <title>Commanders declared WR Deebo Samuel (illness) active for Week 15 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1db7-d77b-adfb-dfb749850000</link>
      <description>As expected, Samuel is active even while dealing with an illness that showed up on the injury report Friday. He should see a good amount of targets, but this Washington passing game is tough to have a ton of confidence in right now.</description>

      <title>Cardinals declared RB Emari Demercado (ankle) active for Arizona’s Week 15 game against the Texans.</title>

      <description>He figures to see a chunk of the receiving work and should at least be a viable desperation FLEX in his return. Inactive for the Cardinals are: WR Marvin Harrison JR. (heel), CB Max Melton (heel), S Jalen Thompson (hamstring), S Rabbit Taylor-Demerson (ankle), OL Evan Brown (personal), OL Paris Johnson (knee) and WR Xavier Weaver (hamstring) — all with designations. Every questionable Cardinals player is playing — OT Christian Jones (knee), DL Walter Nolen (knee), and TE Elijah Higgins (illness) are all up.</description>

      <title>Eagles declared DT Jalen Carter, RB A.J. Dillon, QB Sam Howell, RT Lane Johnson, CB Mac McWilliams and EDGE Joshua Uche inactive for Week 15 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1db3-d77b-adfb-dfb31fc60000</link>
      <description>The Eagles’ big-name linemen — Carter and Johnson — remain week to week. Although Johnson reportedly has a decent shot at returning for Week 16, Carter’s status remains unknown as he recovers from shoulder surgery.</description>

      <title>Rashod Bateman (ankle) is inactive for Week 15 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1db6-d77b-adfb-dfb783ad0000</link>
      <description>Bateman was questionable entering the weekend but has been officially sidelined for Sunday’s game. DeAndre Hopkins will likely serve as his replacement on Sunday against the Bengals, but Hopkins is an easy fade for fantasy managers give then he hasn’t caught more than two passes in any game this season. In addition to Bateman, the Ravens also declared CB Keyon Martin, OT Joseph Noteboom, DT Aeneas Peebles, and QB Cooper Rush inactive for Week 15.</description>

      <title>Giants declared OLB Kayvon Thibodeaux, QB Russell Wilson, WR Ryan Miller P Jamie Gillan, T James Hudson III, WR Gunner Olszewski and DL Rakeem Nuñez-Roches Sr. inactive for Week 15 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1db5-d1bc-a3fb-9db52d990000</link>
      <description>Thibodeaux remains out with his shoulder injury, and there’s a good chance he won’t return in 2025. Wilson will again be the emergency quarterback behind Jaxon Dart and Jameis Winston.</description>

      <title>Bears declared QB Tyson Bagent, RB Travis Homer, DE Dominique Robinson, DT Jonathan Ford, LB Ruben Hyppolite II, and WR Jahdae Walker inactive for Week 15 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1db8-d77b-adfb-dfbbdff40000</link>
      <description>Bagent was sent home with an illness and Case Keenum will serve as Caleb Williams’ backup for Week 15 against the Browns. Otherwise, the Bears are fairly healthy with four games left in the regular season.</description>

      <title>Bengals declared WR Tee Higgins, QB Jake Browning, S JP Jules, and DT Jordan Jefferson inactive for Week 15 against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1dba-d005-a9bf-ddbe578a0000</link>
      <description>Higgins was ruled out on Friday due to the concussion he suffered in Week 14’s loss to the Bills. His absence will create a bigger role for WR Mitchell Tinsley, who saw a season-high nine targets in Week 13 against the Ravens when Higgins was sidelined.</description>

      <title>Raiders declared QB Geno Smith (shoulder/back), RB Zamir White, CB Greedy Vance, OL Jordan Meredith (foot), TE Ian Thomas (calf), WR Alex Bachman (thumb) and DL Leki Fotu inactive for Las Vegas’ Week 15 game against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1dbc-d8cf-affb-bdbe50e80000</link>
      <description>Meredith and Thomas were on the questionable line while Smith and Bachman were ruled out on Friday. No major changes from expectations here; Kenny Pickett will start against the Eagles in a #RevengeGame and figures to be one of the weaker superflex options on the slate today.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1dbc-d8cf-affb-bdbe50e80000</guid>

      <title>Chiefs declared WR Hollywood Brown, OT Jawaan Taylor, OG Trey Smith, TE Jared Wiley, CB Trent McDuffie, DT Zacch Pickens, and RB Elijah Mitchell inactive for Week 15 against the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1db8-d005-a9bf-ddbcf4f30000</link>
      <description>Brown will sit out Kansas City’s crucial Week 15 tilt against the Chargers for personal reasons. His absence could open up more routes and targets for JuJu Smith-Schuster. The Chiefs will also be without McDuffie, making Justin Herbert’s matchup a little better. Herbert is a borderline option in one-QB leagues even with McDuffie out.</description>

      <title>Browns declared RG Wyatt Teller (calf), DT Adin Huntington (quad), RT Jack Conklin (concussion), CB Denzel Ward (calf), RB Dylan Sampson (calf), TE David Njoku (knee) and G Zak Zinter (back) inactive for Week 15 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-1dbc-d8cf-affb-bdbe9c410000</link>
      <description>No surprises on the Browns inactives as Dylan Sampson was ruled out earlier in the week. His absence is a boost for Quinshon Judkins, who should see more receiving work with Sampson sidelined. LG Joel Bitonio (knee, back), WR Cedric Tillman (concussion, rib), DT Mason Graham (rib), and WR Malachi Corley (concussion) are active after being listed as questionable.</description>
