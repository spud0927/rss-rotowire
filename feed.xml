      <title>Tre Tucker caught 3-of-8 passes for 12 yards in the Chargers’ Week 2 loss to the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-50c8-d294-a19b-f4f8b1310000</link>
      <description>Geno Smith was wholly ineffective Monday night, and Tucker was one of a few Las Vegas receivers who didn’t have much success on a night where the Raiders didn’t complete a single pass thrown over 10 yards. It’s worth noting that Tucker doubled the targets of Dont’e Thornton (one catch, 20 yards on four passes thrown his way), and he’s pretty clearly the WR2 on the Raiders’ for now. He’s nowhere close to that range from a fantasy perspective for Week 3 against the Commanders.</description>

      <title>Jets head coach Aaron Glenn said it would be “hard” to start QB Justin Fields (concussion) if he doesn’t practice on Wednesday or Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-5269-da67-a99f-defda9e70000</link>
      <description>It sounds like Fields, who suffered a head injury in the second half of the Jets’ Week 2 loss to the Bills, won’t suit up if he can’t get on the practice field by Thursday. Fields, who had never had a documented brain injury before Week 2, is in the league’s concussion protocol. Tyrod Taylor would be under center for the Jets in Week 3 against the Bucs if Fields can’t go. “We have to get more information so we can be more pinpointed on that, but we do have to look at it that way,” Glenn said. “If Justin can’t play, then Tyrod would be the guy, and we’d build a plan that’s suitable for him.” Glenn said he has “no concerns” about Taylor, 36, who completed seven of 11 attempts for 56 yards and a touchdown against Buffalo. Taylor would be a decent option in superflex formats if he starts.</description>

      <title>Bengals signed QB Mike White, formerly of the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-528f-d654-a19b-d2ef96100000</link>
      <description>The Bengals are scrambling for practice squad quarterbacks after losing Joe Burrow (toe) for most of the rest of the regular season. Jake Browning will take over at QB with Burrow sidelined, and White — who completed 12-of-24 passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns for Buffalo in the preseason — could eventually make his way onto the game day roster. The Bengals also signed QB Sean Clifford, formerly of the Packers.</description>

      <description>Clifford will join newly signed Mike White on the Cincy practice squad as Jake Browning takes over at quarterback for the remainder of the season following Joe Burrow’s season-ending toe injury. Brett Rypien is expected to be the team’s backup to Clifford. Either White or Clifford will serve as QB3. Clifford completed 9-of-17 attempts for 44 scoreless yards in three preseason outings for Green Bay last month.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Alec Lewis reports there’s “no guarantee” LT Christian Darrisaw (knee) plays in Week 3 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-52f6-d606-a5db-5ef61b250000</link>
      <description>The Vikings offensive line has struggled mightily through two games with Darrisaw out and C Ryan Kelly dealing with a head injury. J.J. McCarthy, who’s out for multiple weeks with an ankle sprain, has been pressured on 40 percent of his drop backs through Week 2, the eighth highest rate in the NFL. No Darrisaw for Minnesota would be a potential problem for QB Carson Wentz as he takes over the Vikings offense in McCarthy’s absence. Pro Football Focus grades the Bengals’ pass rush as the 13th best in the league through two weeks.</description>

      <title>Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said CB Joey Porter Jr. (hamstring) is “questionable at best” for Week 3.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-533b-d654-a19b-d37b4ea90000</link>
      <description>Porter missed last week’s loss to the Seahawks while recovering from a hamstring injury and could sit out this week against the Patriots. The Steelers’ secondary has struggled to start the season, allowing the NFL’s sixth highest adjusted yards per attempt and the seventh highest accuracy rate. Porter’s absence could be a boon for Drake Maye in Week 3.</description>

      <title>Bucs DT Calijah Kancey is out for the remainder of the season with a torn pec.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-537c-dfa0-a9bb-dbfea9e30000</link>
      <description>Kancey sustained the injury on Monday night against the Texans. He’ll undergo surgery and miss the rest of the season. Kancey has 11.5 sacks over the past two seasons and has been a critical piece of Tampa’s stifling rush defense. The Bucs could be a little more vulnerable to opposing rushers with Kancey sidelined.</description>

      <title>Eagles OC Kevin Patullo said designed quarterback runs and keepers for Jalen Hurts “are coming.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-5379-d051-a3df-7ff923450000</link>
      <description>Patullo said that they haven’t gotten to use Hurts like this because of how they’re being defended. He added: “Don’t worry.” It would go a long way towards avoiding disastrous lines such as Sunday’s if Hurts could actually get more involved in the running game, and with Saquon Barkley also struggling to generate space, perhaps that would help matters. The Eagles have already run 32 plays against eight or men in the box this year per TruMedia — they may need to prove that they can pass their way out of it before things get better.</description>

      <title>Panthers signed C Nick Samac off the Ravens practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-537e-d606-a5db-5ffe5fdc0000</link>
      <description>Reinforcements are on the way for Carolina after they had to place Austin Corbett and Robert Hunt on the practice squad. Samac will back up Cade Mays and Chandler Zavala, who will get the first crack at starting roles on the interior line.</description>

      <title>Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said he “expects” to get Christian Kirk (hamstring) back in Week 3.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-5392-d654-a19b-d3f2def90000</link>
      <description>We’ll monitor the practice status ahead of Week 3’s #RevengeGame against the Jaguars for Kirk, but it’s a promising sign that the coach is already declaring strongly that he’s expecting Kirk back. Braxton Berrios (also hamstring) is also expected back for the Texans, potentially forecasting a shakeup on a wideout depth chart that hasn’t given anything but Nico Collins incompletions (and one touchdown) to talk about so far.</description>
