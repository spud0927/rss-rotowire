      <title>Luther Burden caught 4-of-4 passes for 51 yards in the Bears’ Week 7 loss to the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e0c7-db72-a199-facf91b00000</link>
      <description>Burden ended up leading the Bears in catches and yardage, which is a vast improvement over the negative-four yards he put up against the Raiders. The shifty 21-year-old rookie did most of his damage on a 37-yard connection to set up a score. There is considerable upside in Burden’s profile, but there just aren’t enough touches to suggest he’s worth a fantasy roster spot right now in redraft formats.</description>

      <title>DJ Moore caught 3-of-5 passes for 42 yards in the Bears’ Week 6 win over the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e0c8-dd4c-afb9-e7c907ca0000</link>
      <description>Another quiet yardage day for Moore, and no trips to the end zone. The 28-year-old has now gone under 50 yards in four-straight games, and he hasn’t made up for it with touchdowns as seen in just one in 2025. Moore could find room against the Saints’ weak secondary in Week 7, but he is more FLEX play than someone who has to be in lineups.</description>

      <title>Rome Odunze caught 2-of-5 targets for 32 yards in the Bears’ Week 6 win over the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e0cf-dd4c-afb9-e7cfcc670000</link>
      <description>Odunze nearly had his fantasy day saved with an 11-yard touchdown, but that was negated by a penalty. It was a quiet day for the second-year wideout in a contest where the Bears relied heavily on D’Andre Swift in the run game. Expect Odunze to bounce back with more touches — and a potential trip to the end zone — against the Saints in Week 7.</description>

      <title>Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel said the team’s running backs might be focusing too much on ball security.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e29b-dd4c-afb9-e7dbdd1e0000</link>
      <description>That focus on not fumbling, Vrabel said, is limiting some rushing plays in the Patriots offense. His comments come after a rash of fumbles and miscues from New England running backs during the first month of the regular season. Against a middling Saints defense in Week 6, Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson combined for 45 yards on 22 carries in another pass-first game plan. It’s hard to say when — or if — the team’s backs will pay a proper amount of focus on not fumbling and costing the team points and themselves playing time. For now, Stevenson appears to be the nominal lead runner for the Patriots, who this week take on a Titans defense allowing 4.6 yards per rush.</description>

      <title>Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell said he’s helping J.J. McCarthy (ankle) on “building that foundation back up.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e2ed-db72-a199-faefa11f0000</link>
      <description>O’Connell has reportedly spent the bye week working with McCarthy on improving his mechanics, especially his footwork, an area of concern over the season’s first two games before McCarthy apparently sustained a serious ankle injury that has kept him sidelined for more than a month. Concerns about McCarthy’s unrefined mechanics stretch back to the offseason, when the second-year QB would miss easy throws and held the ball long enough for the pass rush to get home in practices. O’Connell and the Vikings might have no choice but to turn back to McCarthy in Week 7 against the Eagles with Carson Wentz “managing a serious left shoulder injury,” according to The Athletic’s Alec Lewis. McCarthy would be a significant downgrade for all of Minnesota’s pass catchers.</description>

      <title>Bears WR DJ Moore (unknown) was hospitalized Monday evening following the Week 6 win over the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e393-dd4c-afb9-e7d3de970000</link>
      <description>We’re still waiting on an update from the team after Moore finished the game against the Commanders but was mysteriously hospitalized Monday evening in the Washington area. Moore was notably seen blocking 15 yards downfield on the team’s final drive of the game, leading to the game-winning field goal. He did not travel home with the team while spending the night in a D.C. area hospital.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Chiefs OC Matt Nagy and Steelers OC Arthur Smith are “names to watch” for the Titans head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e3af-db72-a199-fbefd0660000</link>
      <description>These are both very logical fits as GM Mike Borgonzi has worked with Nagy on the Chiefs and Smith was a long-time Titans OC under Mike Vrabel. There’s familiarity with both of them in the building. Neither hire would be particularly inspiring as failed head coaches in Atlanta and Chicago, respectively. But of course it’s going to take a while for the coaching candidate cycle to truly pick up and we don’t know yet who will emerge as a new name.</description>

      <title>Titans OL coach Bill Callahan resigned.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e3be-d94a-a79d-ebbfd3500000</link>
      <description>Not a huge surprise, after all, they did fire his son from the head-coaching role. Callahan will be a coveted offseason coaching free agent and has a long history of success turning around bad offensive lines despite not delivering on that promise with the Titans.</description>

      <title>Ravens released C.J. Gardner-Johnson from their practice squad.</title>

      <title>Falcons LT Jake Matthews (ankle) left Atlanta’s Week 6 game against the Bills and did not return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e3d5-d94a-a79d-ebddcec70000</link>
      <description>It’s one injury to watch ahead of Week 7, though it wasn’t like the Falcons had major problems on the offensive line without the 33-year-old veteran. Mike Jerrell played left tackle in Matthews’ absence for most of the second half on Monday.</description>
