      <title>Broncos coach Sean Payton said “I’ve got to be better there” when asked about running the ball only three times against 17 passes in the first quarter.</title>

      <description>“It’s one of those day-afters where you look back and say, ‘Alright, let’s look at how we really wanted to start that game and get those two runners going,’ because we think we’ve really improved in that area,” Payton continued. Bo Nix didn’t do much with the added volume and Denver eventually wound up rushing for five yards a carry against the Titans. It sounds like the Broncos could employ a more run-heavy approach against the Colts in Week 2, which should help J.K. Dobbins and RJ Harvey in fantasy football.</description>

      <title>Panthers DT Tershawn Wharton (hamstring) will miss 2-4 weeks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b18-dbe3-a9bb-3b5bc8700000</link>
      <description>With four weeks in play, the Panthers might consider placing Wharton on injured reserve. “He was having a fantastic game,’' Panthers coach Dave Canales said of Wharton. “He had four tackles early on, and was really doing a good job of getting of blocks and making opportunities.’' The Panthers figure to remain easy to run on in Week 2, which is good news for James Conner and Trey Benson.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Colby Parkinson suffered a sprained AC join in the Rams’ Week 1 win over the Texans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b22-dbe3-a9bb-3b73d5f20000</link>
      <description>This injury doesn’t bear any weight on the fantasy community, but Parkinson, who did play through the injury, appeared on 29 offensive snaps for the Rams last season and has been a key player on their offense since joining them last offseason. It’s possible he’ll play in Week 2 against the Titans, but if not, Davis Allen would appear next in line to play in 2TE sets.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reports the Eagles are hosting free agent WR Quez Watkins for a workout on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b2a-de13-afdd-6feb50410000</link>
      <description>Watkins was a sixth-round pick of the Eagles back in 2020 and caught 98 passes for 1,249 yards and six touchdowns during his four-year tenure with the team. He hasn’t played a regular season snap since 2023 and has also bounced around between the Steelers and Cardinals over the last two years. If signed, Watkins wouldn’t be any more than added depth to a receiver room that is currently five players deep. In addition to Watkins, the Eagles also hosted WR K.J. Osborn and DE Isaiah Foskey for workouts.</description>

      <title>Rams HC Sean McVay said OG Kevin Dotson is week-to-week with a sprained ankle.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b3b-d332-a1fd-bf3f8a430000</link>
      <description>Dotson suffered what is being called a lateral ankle sprain in the Rams’ Week 1 win over the Texans. The sixth-year pro is in his third year with the Rams and has started every game he’s appeared in since 2023. Whether or not Dotson lands on injured reserve will likely be determined in the coming days. For now, he’ll likely be replaced by backup guard Justin Dedich.</description>

      <title>Ravens HC John Harbaugh said “the number of snaps you can get Keaton (Mitchell) on offense are pretty limited” when asked about the decision to scratch him in Week 1 against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b46-dbe3-a9bb-3b57aa630000</link>
      <description>It’s a brutal quote for anybody stashing Mitchell in hopes of an eventual role emerging. Harbaugh highlighted the fact that Mitchell taking the field would be on “designer plays” that could tip off the defense as to who the ball is going to. For obvious reasons, Harbaugh has no interest in taking Derrick Henry or Justice Hill off the field to work in these plays, and said Mitchell also needs to improve on special teams if he hopes to see the field. There’s nothing to get excited about here as far as Mitchell is concerned. We’ll see if anything changes as the season progresses, but he holds no fantasy value at this time.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports Bears CB Jaylon Johnson (calf/groin) is out for Week 1 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b67-db7b-a5dd-ab6717c30000</link>
      <description>Johnson went through warmups but reportedly “needs another week” before healthy enough to take the field. It’s a sizable blow to a secondary tasked with slowing down Justin Jefferson on Monday Night Football, which will now be forced to so without their All-Pro cornerback. Expect Nahshon Wright and Jaylon Jones to soak up his vacated snaps opposite Tyrique Stevenson. Also inactive for the Bears are DB Kyler Gordon, QB Case Keenum, RB Roschon Johnson, LB T.J. Edwards, and DL Shemar Turner.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports 49ers QB Brock Purdy (shoulder/toe) is uncertain for Week 2 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b7b-d332-a1fd-bf7f6cb60000</link>
      <description>The 49ers emerged from their Week 1 victory over the Seahawks with three significant injuries, losing George Kittle for multiple weeks with a hamstring injury, Jauan Jennings to a shoulder injury, and Purdy to multiple ailments. Purdy’s status for Week 2 remains up in the air, with Schefter saying the team will “see how the week goes.” Mac Jones would be in line to start against the Saints if Purdy can’t go and would be charged with leading an offense decimated by injury.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan said TE George Kittle (hamstring) will miss multiple games.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b7e-dbe3-a9bb-3b7fac510000</link>
      <description>The 49ers emerged from Week 1 with multiple key injuries, including Kittle, quarterback Brock Purdy, and wide receiver Jauan Jennings. Kittle’s absence is especially damning considering his role in the offense, something that could completely change the team’s preparations for the Saints when taken in conjunction with a potential absence from Purdy. Fantasy managers will want to make other plans at tight end for the coming weeks.</description>

      <title>Vikings OT Christian Darrisaw (knee) is inactive for Week 1 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2b83-db7b-a5dd-ab87347b0000</link>
      <description>The veteran tackles’s absence is a massive blow to a Vikings team already without Jordan Addison due to suspension. The Vikings do get some good news as Jaylon Johnson is inactive for the Bears, lessening the matchup on the perimeter for Justin Jefferson. Darrisaw was reportedly close to suiting up but will require at least one more week before returning to the field to protect J.J. McCarthy. Also inactive for the Vikings are S Harrison Smith, RB Zavier Scott, G Joe Huber, DL Elijah Williams, and QB Max Brosmer.</description>
