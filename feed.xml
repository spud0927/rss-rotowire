      <title>49ers T Trent Williams (hamstring) left San Francisco’s Week 17 game against the Bears and did not return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6ab7-d968-a19b-7af753060000</link>
      <description>He played just one snap. Austen Pleasants replaced him. Williams being ruled out and seen hobbling on the sideline with what The Athletic’s Matt Barrows called a hamstring strain does not bode well for his availability for Week 18.</description>

      <title>Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka told reporters he has no doubts that QB Jaxson Dart has proven he’s a franchise quarterback.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6ab6-dc7a-af9b-efbfc5a40000</link>
      <description>Dart bounced back from a 33-yard performance in the Week 16 loss to the Vikings to throw for 207 yards in the win over the Raiders Sunday. The 22-year-old signal caller’s future with the organization is a topic for discussion with the Giants currently in control of the No. 2 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and the team’s coaching situation in flux. While Kafka could remain the head coach next year, the Giants are said to be interested in speaking with a list of candidates that could include Notre Dame’s Marcus Freeman. In a sense, an endorsement from Kafka is relatively meaningless as he doesn’t currently have much of a say in the future direction of the franchise. Dart will have one more chance to make an impression against the Cowboys in Week 18 before what’s likely to be an offseason full of changes in New York.</description>

      <title>Patriots LT Will Campbell (knee) will return to practice this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6aca-dc7a-af9b-efff79fa0000</link>
      <description>Campbell was placed on injured reserve after suffering a torn MCL in Week 12 against the Bengals. The 21-year-old left tackle will have his 21-day practice window opened this week. He’s eligible to return from injured reserve for Week 18’s matchup with the Dolphins, though the Patriots will have to see him practice first. If all goes well, it looks like the Patriots will be getting a big piece of their offensive line back ahead of a potentially deep playoff run.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Bears LB Noah Sewell suffered a torn Achilles and is out for the rest of the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6b0c-d968-a19b-7bfd0cdc0000</link>
      <description>Sewell had appeared in 13 games this year, starting nine of them. The 23-year-old linebacker had 59 tackles including three tackles for loss and one forced fumble. His 41.5 overall PFF grade ranked 81st out of 86 linebackers. Sewell was carted off the field after suffering an injury in the third quarter of the Bears’ Week 17 loss to the 49ers. He’ll miss the rest of the season with a torn Achilles.</description>

      <title>Bengals head coach Zac Taylor told reporters Joe Burrow will play in Week 18 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6b12-d35e-a1bf-6fd2d18b0000</link>
      <description>Taylor said that Burrow gives them the best chance to win, which is both true and not really the point anymore given the Bengals were officially eliminated from playoff contention weeks ago. Burrow is wrapping up his second season in the last three years in which he appeared in 10 games or less due to injury. A significant injury against the Browns in Week 18 would be absolutely devastating for the Bengals and Burrow, who carries a nearly $48 million cap hit in 2026. Maybe Taylor comes to his senses before game-time or he lets Joe Flacco at least play the second half, but he’s remained consistent in recent weeks about Burrow playing.</description>

      <title>Note Dame head coach Marcus Freeman will remain the Fighting Irish’s head coach in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6b3e-d56e-afff-effe45710000</link>
      <description>He had been a rumored target for NFL teams in the coaching carousel this year and drew interest from the Bears last offseason. The Giants, in particular, had been linked to Freeman. Still just 39, Freeman probably will have more NFL interviews in the future. For now, it seems like Freeman got a nice raise out of being linked around the coaching cycle, so that’s just good business by him.</description>

      <title>Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio reports T.J. Watt is a “long shot” to play in Pittsburgh’s Week 18 game against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6b47-dc7a-af9b-efff1dca0000</link>
      <description>“Never say never but not an ideal timeline to be fully cleared,” the source added. PFT also adds that Mike Tomlin told CBS’ Tracy Wolfson that Watt won’t play until he has a “week of practice as a full participant,” meaning the tea leaves could reveal themselves rather quickly on Wednesday. Watt got in three limited practices last week.</description>

      <title>Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio reports “various high-level executives” believe Vikings DC Brian Flores will “most likely be a candidate” for a head-coaching job this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6b49-d968-a19b-7bf94d960000</link>
      <description>His lingering litigation against the NFL for discriminatory hiring practices has not stopped teams from realizing he runs a great defense. Flores interviewed for the Bears head-coaching job last year, and was also requested to interview by the Jets and Jaguars in the carousel. Despite several injuries and a (quarterback-driven) bad offense, Flores’ Vikings enter the final week of the regular season fourth in defensive DVOA.</description>

      <title>Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said QB J.J. McCarthy (hand) is “progressing” and that the swelling has come down a bit.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6b6b-d35e-a1bf-6feb77410000</link>
      <description>The Vikings will see how McCarthy’s grip strength is at the end of the week. It still feels like it’s more likely that McCarthy sits if they’re only really going to check him at week’s end, but the door is at least cracked a little for a Week 18 return against Green Bay. If McCarthy sits again, Max Brosmer will likely get to close out the season with his unique sack-taking stylings. O’Connell did notably say that he wants all quarterbacks (including John Wolford and Brett Rypien) to be “ready to play.”</description>

      <title>Rams activated CB Roger McCreary (hip) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6b79-d968-a19b-7bf95dc30000</link>
      <description>McCreary played four games for the Rams earlier this season after being acquired from the Titans before the trade deadline. His return will help cover over the loss of Quintin Lake as the Rams look to get their defense back on track ahead of the playoffs.</description>
