      <title>Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said he doesn’t expect WR Tory Horton (shin) to “do anything in the spring.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a0ee-d042-afbc-fdfe1e480000</link>
      <description>He got “fixed up” in Macdonald’s lingo — we assume that means surgery — and is likely questionable for the start of training camp given how much time he missed with this shin injury in the 2025 season. If healthy, Horton could challenge for a real role next year depending on if the Seahawks bring Rashid Shaheed back or not.</description>

      <title>Titans GM Mike Borgonzi said the team’s goal is to “get something done” with OL Peter Skoronski.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a0f0-d629-a1bc-b0fd46a30000</link>
      <description>Skoronski is entering his fifth-year option offseason off the best year of his career. The 24-year-old put up a 79.0 PFF grade — compared to 60.4 and 61.6 in his first two seasons — and turned into one of the main linchpins of the line. Given how much cap space they have and how few truly great players are in this free agent class, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the Titans try to get out in front of keeping Skoronski.</description>

      <title>Cowboys extended a second-round tender to restricted free agent G T.J. Bass.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a0fe-dbf6-abdd-eeff4b2b0000</link>
      <description>He will make about $5.8 million in 2026. Bass started five games last year and finished with a career-best 67.6 PFF blocking grade. He’s valuable depth for the Cowboys and they’ll be able to match any offer he receives in free agency or allow him to walk for a second-round pick — very few restricted free agents are actually signed, so we expect he’ll be back in Dallas.</description>

      <title>Chicago Tribune’s Brad Biggs believes DT Logan Hall will “have a robust market in free agency.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a107-d042-afbc-fdd775fd0000</link>
      <description>Hall managed a career-best 66.8 PFF defensive grade in 2025 — not saying much, but he was much improved from his rookie form — and managed 26 hurries. Biggs notes that he’s scheme-versatile and said something “approaching $10 million per season wouldn’t be a surprise” based on his conversations with several agents. We did not blurb Hall at all in the final year of his rookie deal, but it appears he may be a surprise contract in free agency ahead of his age-26 season.</description>

      <title>Chicago Tribune’s Brad Biggs believes the Bears would probably need “a second-round pick (or two picks equaling that value)” to make it “worthwhile” to trade Tyson Bagent.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a10d-d89c-a1be-afdf6f950000</link>
      <description>“I’m not sure a team would offer a Round 2 pick for Bagent. It’s worth noting the Bears have had meetings with agents representing some No. 2-type quarterbacks, so they’re putting contingency plans in place,” Biggs continues while specifically pointing out that the Jets are a team that could look to go the budget route at quarterback. Of all the things that happened during the NFL Combine, the hard-launching of the Tyson Bagent Trade Complex was definitely one of them. The desperation is real for those without a solidified quarterback position.</description>

      <title>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McLane believes a decision by the Eagles on keeping or trading A.J. Brown will be made “in the next 10 days” ahead of the start of the legal tampering period.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a117-d042-afbc-fdd7a1e60000</link>
      <description>McLane has talked to several sources about this at the combine and doesn’t make a real guess on if Brown will be traded — the article is full of Mike Vrabel quotes, if you want a sense of a lean — but also mentions the Ravens and Bills as teams that could use a Brown to get over the championship hump. He notes that if Howie Roseman doesn’t get the compensation he wants, he’ll simply keep Brown. Brown’s 2026 team will determine a lot about the next few weeks in the NFL, but it sounds like it will simply unfold based on how willing the market will be to give Roseman the kind of premium draft assets he’d desire.</description>

      <title>Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander believes that the Texans could consider a trade for De’Von Achane.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a122-d042-afbc-fdf250420000</link>
      <description>Achane is mentioned as part of a major section of Alexander’s combine takeaways titled “A push for a running back,” starring Kenneth Walker and also featuring Travis Etienne and Rico Dowdle. But towards the very end, it notes that the Texans did trade for a back after missing out on the free-agent market for Saquon Barkley when they snagged Joe Mixon. We doubt that the Dolphins would part with Achane for something negligible — they’d likely require real draft compensation — but the situation certainly looks to be focused on the long-term there and Achane is entering the final year of his rookie contract.</description>

      <title>Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander reports that support for C.J. Stroud “remains strong inside the organization.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a131-d042-afbc-fdf3c08f0000</link>
      <description>He adds that the Texans will engage in talks with Stroud’s representation “at some point” about a long-term contract, the expectation is that any potential long-term extension wouldn’t get done this offseason. It’s sensible for the Texans to not get out ahead of the Stroud talks after last year’s playoff flatlining. It’s also sensible for the Texans to look at all 52 games that he’s played, rather than just his last two, when thinking about what they expect from him going forward. The Texans will try to build up around Stroud ahead of the last two years of his rookie contract to see what they can get out of him, and Alexander believes an improved running game should also take some of the pressure off of him.</description>

      <title>Ravens head coach Jesse Minter said “I don’t know that he needs to run more, I actually think there’s times where he can run less” when asked about Lamar Jackson running more.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a161-d89c-a1be-affff5e00000</link>
      <description>There’s an element of this answer that nods to an ideal world, because the times where he can run less are based on “if you build an offense that takes advantage of the under center, the downhill run game. Now that opens up a lot of boots and play actions.” But it’s not what fantasy football managers want to hear after last season’s scant 67/349/2 line while struggling through injuries. Entering his age-29 season, it wouldn’t be surprising if Jackson’s game evolved. It certainly sounds like his head coach would rather it evolve than not.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Alaina Getzenberg believes Khalil Shakir is “likely taking on a bigger role” in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-a170-d042-afbc-fdf23fcd0000</link>
      <description>Joe Brady said he was one of the team’s best football players and said that there are other ways to get the ball in his hands than just in the screen game. We’re not sure how seriously to take this at the combine, before the Bills bring in what the actual competition will be — we don’t think Shakir is going to take on a bigger role if A.J. Brown or D.J. Moore show up — but it’s at least worthwhile to note that Brady loves Shakir and he seems ticketed to have a major role in the passing offense in 2026.</description>
