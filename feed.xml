      <title>Philip Rivers completed 23-of-35 passes for 277 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the Colts’ 48-27, Week 16 loss to the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4995-d56e-afff-effd90020000</link>
      <description>Rivers and the Colts traded blows with the 49ers throughout the first half, with the aging veteran connecting with Alec Pierce for two scores before the break. The Colts would struggle to keep the momentum rolling into the second half while managing just 10 points after the break, but many will likely be left with the memory of the surgical precision the 44-year-old showed to open the game rather than the couple of under-thrown balls late. The Colts were eliminated from the postseason with the loss, potentially signaling a change back to rookie Riley Leonard under center for the team’s final two games of the regular season. Either way, Rivers’ return to the league after five years will go down as one of the crazier storylines of the 2025 season and should only pad his chances of heading to the Hall of Fame.</description>

      <title>Jonathan Taylor rushed 16 times for 46 yards and a touchdown in the Colts’ Week 16 loss to the 49ers, adding 33 yards on three receptions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-499b-d56e-afff-effb6b380000</link>
      <description>Taylor struggled throughout behind an injury-ravaged offensive line against a defense many before him had found success against. He salvaged his fantasy outing with a touchdown plunge from one yard out in the fourth quarter to bring the team within seven points, a deficit they ultimately fell short of overcoming. The Colts could also be turning back to rookie Riley Leonard under center moving forward now that they are eliminated from the playoffs, something that could dent his fantasy upside over the final two weeks of the regular season.</description>

      <title>Alec Pierce caught all four targets for 86 yards and two touchdowns in the Colts’ Week 16 loss to the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-49a0-d968-a19b-59f174130000</link>
      <description>Pierce was shot out of a cannon, connecting with veteran quarterback Philip Rivers on two first half touchdowns as the two teams traded blows early. He added his longest reception of the evening in the second half on a 33-yard grab as the team fought to keep their season alive, only to fall short while being eliminated from postseason contention. Pierce might have a very different fantasy outlook for the final two weeks of the regular season if the team turns back to rookie Riley Leonard under center.</description>

      <title>Josh Downs caught 5-of-9 targets for 65 yards in the Colts’ Week 16 loss to the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-49a4-d56e-afff-efec0a3f0000</link>
      <description>Downs tied with rookie tight end Tyler Warren for the team lead in targets and ranked behind only Alec Pierce in receiving yardage, relied on heavily out of the slot against the heavy zone rates of the 49ers. The 2025 season was not as kind to Downs’ fantasy managers as initially thought heading into the year, with Warren’s breakout a large reason why. He’ll enter the final year of his rookie contract in 2026.</description>

      <title>Michael Pittman caught 4-of-5 targets for 32 yards in the Colts’ Week 16 loss to the 49ers.</title>

      <description>Pittman trailed rookie tight end Tyler Warren and slot receiver Josh Downs in targets while Alec Pierce erupted for two touchdowns, routinely finding it difficult to shake free on the perimeter against the zone-heavy 49ers. Veteran quarterback Philip Rivers simply relied heavily on his targets over the middle of the field, something that could change if the team elects to turn back to Riley Leonard under center for the final two games of the regular season now that they are eliminated from the playoffs.</description>

      <title>Tyler Warren caught 3-of-9 targets for 30 yards in the Colts’ Week 16 loss to the 49ers.</title>

      <description>Warren tied for the team lead with nine targets, his second consecutive game leading the team in targets with Philip Rivers under center. That could change for the final two weeks of the regular season with the Colts now eliminate from the playoffs, potentially turning back to rookie Riley Leonard to finish out the season. Either way, Warren remains one of the more intriguing young tight ends in the league and appears primed to return significant value for dynasty managers moving forward.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Brooke Pryor reports DK Metcalf’s suspension could void $45 million in contract guarantees.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4b7e-d56e-afff-effee8930000</link>
      <description>Metcalf plans on appealing the two-game suspension that was handed down after his altercation with a fan in Detroit on Sunday. Metcalf said the fan, Ryan Kennedy, used a racial slur — an accusation Kennedy has denied through a lawyer. Metcalf had reported Kennedy to Seahawks team security in a previous trip to Detroit to play the Lions before he was traded to the Steelers. If the two-game suspension is upheld, the Steelers offense will likely revert to a run-heavy approach for the final two games of the regular season against the Browns and Ravens. Calvin Austin and Adam Thielen could see an uptick in targets, along with Kenneth Gainwell and Darnell Washington.</description>

      <title>Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel said RB TreVeyon Henderson is in the NFL’s concussion protocol.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4c05-d968-a19b-5cf5460f0000</link>
      <description>Henderson suffered the head injury in the first half on Sunday night against the Ravens and did not return to the game. He could very well miss Week 17 against a miserable Jets defense that has been more than generous to opposing backs in recent weeks. Rhamondre Stevenson, who had eight carries for 51 yards and a touchdown against Baltimore in Week 16, would profile as a must-play option in 12-team formats if Henderson is sidelined. Both backs are in play for Week 17 if Henderson clears the protocol and suits up against the Jets.</description>

      <title>Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel said WR Kayshon Boutte is in the league’s concussion protocol.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4c09-d56e-afff-eee93f6b0000</link>
      <description>Boutte sustained the head injury in Week 16 against the Ravens while catching four passes for 35 yards. He would appear to be highly questionable to Week 17 against a Jets secondary that ranks among the worst in the league. If Boutte is sidelined, Mack Hollins — who ranks fourth in the NFL in air yards over the past three weeks — would be an excellent flex play for Week 17. Kyle Williams, who caught a touchdown in Week 16’s win, would have some deep league appeal if Boutte is sidelined.</description>

      <title>Jaguars head coach Liam Coen said the offense has not “changed a single thing” since the summer.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4c23-d35e-a1bf-4de354a50000</link>
      <description>“We haven’t changed a single thing from the moment we started coaching him,” Coen said when asked by reporters if the team’s offense had been tweaked ahead of Trevor Lawrence’s recent heater, which includes 12 total touchdowns over his past three games. “Sometimes, it just takes time to click.” Lawrence, according to Coen, showed more comfort with progressions and reads around Week 10 after a somewhat shaky start to the season. The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports the acquisition of Jakobi Meyers has been a key to Lawrence’s emergence as an elite QB. Meyers’ “command over the middle of the field, coupled with tight end Brenton Strange’s return, has helped receivers like Brian Thomas Jr. and Parker Washington produce outside the numbers,” Howe said. “Beyond that, Lawrence’s footwork has also been cleaner, and he’s cut back on unnecessary off-platform throws. It’s all tied into confidence in his reads and progressions.” Lawrence will have a good shot to keep his hot streak going in Week 17 against a listless Colts defense that gave up 295 yards and five touchdowns to Brock Purdy on Monday night.</description>
