      <title>Rams signed HC Sean McVay to a contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1f30-d042-afbc-7ff2ce450000</link>
      <description>One of the premier coaches in the league, McVay will remain with the Rams for the foreseeable future. It was a decision that likely came easily to ownership, who have seen their team go 92-57 under McVay’s leadership while also winning a Super Bowl in 2021. McVay has led the Rams to double-digit wins in seven of his nine years, and had the team within a game of his third Super Bowl appearance. While we don’t know the length of McVay’s extension, he will presumably be under contract when the Rams pursue a new franchise quarterback once Matthew Stafford, who turns 38 later this month, eventually calls it quits.</description>

      <title>Rams signed GM Les Snead to a contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1f31-d042-afbc-7ff3d8780000</link>
      <description>Snead first joined the Rams in 2012 and has been with the team through the lowest of lows and the highest of highs. His fortunes took a turn for the better when he hired Sean McVay in 2017, as the Rams have gone 92-57 in the regular season over that span, making two trips to the Super Bowl and winning a championship in 2021. Snead has hit on recent picks like Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams, and Byron Young — to name a few, and has repeatedly had them in contention for the better part of the last decade. The combination of Snead and McVay, who also received an extension, should continue to terrorize the NFC West for the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Rams HC Sean McVay said he “absolutely” expects Davante Adams to return to the team in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1f83-d042-afbc-7fd3b8050000</link>
      <description>McVay added that he has no reason to believe Adams, who is under contract with the team through next season, would not be back. Adams, 33, didn’t stuff the box score with receptions or receiving yards this season, catching just 60 passes for 789 yards, but his 14 receiving touchdowns led all players in the league this season. Adam’s touchdown production kept his fantasy value afloat in 2025, but he’ll likely need to see similar numbers if his managers hope for another top fantasy finish next season.</description>

      <title>Rams HC Sean McVay said “I’m keeping my fingers crossed” that Matthew Stafford returns in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1fb2-d629-a1bc-bfbf35d80000</link>
      <description>Stafford, who turns 38 this month, said he will take “some time” to decide whether or not to return for another season. The 17-year vet is coming off arguably his best season as a pro and could soon take home MVP honors after throwing for 4,707-46-8 while leading the Rams to a 12-5 record. The Rams have a talented roster in place around Stafford that should be more than capable of running things back next season should he decide to return. After coming so close to his second trip to the Super Bowl, it’s hard to imagine him walking away after such a successful season while still playing at a high level.</description>

      <title>Ravens hired former Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver to the same position.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1fc1-d89c-a1be-bfdfb7240000</link>
      <description>It’s a homecoming for Weaver, who spent the first four years of his career as a player with the Ravens and also served on their coaching staff from 2021 to 2023. Weaver fielded several head coaching interviews this coaching cycle and had multiple second interviews. When the dust finally settled on the process, he was left without a head coaching offer, and will now look to takeover a Ravens defense that’s already loaded with talent. Weaver’s defense finished 22nd in yards allowed and 24th in points allowed this season, but ranked in the top-10 in both categories the previous year. With head coach Jesse Minter already set to call plays, Weaver will likely be tasked more with the weekly game planning and preparation alongside Minter.</description>

      <title>Chiefs signed former Saints QB Jake Haener.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1fce-d355-a5bd-9fdeaa970000</link>
      <description>Haener was a fourth-round pick by the Saints back in 2023 and spent the past season on their practice squad. Through two seasons, Haener has appeared in eight games while making one start. He has a career passing line of 226-1-1 on 39 attempts and a 46.2 completion percentage. Assuming he sticks with the team into training camp, Haener will be a long shot to make the 53-man roster.</description>

      <title>Rams HC Sean McVay said Matthew Stafford will not require surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1fd3-d355-a5bd-9fd76f750000</link>
      <description>Stafford played through this injury all season. The same injury sidelined him for much of training camp and raised some doubts about his availability entering the season. Stafford played at an MVP caliber level despite dealing with the injury, and it sounds like the offseason will be all he needs to get right for next season, should he choose to return. Rapoport also noted that “as of at least a couple of days ago,” Stafford’s plan is to play next season.</description>

      <title>Broncos promoted pass game coordinator and QB coach Davis Webb to offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2017-d042-afbc-7dd792340000</link>
      <description>A day after it was reported that Webb was “the leading candidate” to land the Broncos’ offensive coordinator job, the team made it official on Monday. Webb, who fielded multiple offensive coordinator requests this coaching cycle, will remain with the Broncos and finally get a chance to oversee a bit of the offense, although we would assume Payton will remain the team’s primary play-caller. Webb has long been viewed as an up-and-comer in the coaching ranks. A few successful year’s as the Broncos’ OC could put him in line for his first head coaching gig.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo believes the situation between the Browns and DC Jim Schwartz “remain TBD.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2022-d042-afbc-7df292690000</link>
      <description>New head coach Todd Monken is expected to meet with the media on Tuesday, and Garafolo said he doesn’t expect a firm answer on where things stand between the two sides. Schwartz has reportedly already cleaned out his office at the Browns’ facility after being passed over for the head coaching job, but remains under contract with the team. Things will get interesting if the Browns don’t let Brown out of his contract but he still opts to not return to the team. For now, all we can do is wait and see what Monken says about the situation.</description>

      <title>Titans hired 49ers assistant HC Gus Bradley as their defensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2047-d042-afbc-7dd7c3200000</link>
      <description>NFL insider Jordan Schultz was first with the report. Bradley and new Titans head coach Robert Saleh both joined the 49ers last offseason and will now unite in Tennessee. Bradley served as a defensive coordinator from 2017 to 2024, overseeing operations for the Chargers, Raiders, and Colts over that span. A respected, veteran coach, Bradley, will not be tasked with play-calling duties, but will be a highly-valued voice in the room of a defense that finished 28th in points allowed and 21st in yards allowed last season.</description>
