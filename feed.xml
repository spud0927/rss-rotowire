      <title>Rams OL Kevin Dotson, Rob Havenstein, and Steve Avila did not participate in Wednesday’s practice due to ankle injuries.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3622-d332-a1fd-b63681180000</link>
      <description>Dotson, Havenstein, and Avila all popped up on the injury report with ankle issues to start Week 2. Head coach Sean McVay had said Dotson and Avila are week-to-week with their ankle injuries, but Havenstein’s status remains up in the air. Matthew Stafford’s protection will look slim should any or all of these three miss time.</description>

      <title>Bears CB Kyler Gordon (hamstring) and DT Grady Jarrett (knee) were estimated non-participants in Wednesday’s walk-through practice.</title>

      <description>Gordon and Jarrett were the only non-participants for Chicago on Wednesday. Gordon has been rehabbing a hamstring strain since last month and missed Week 1. Meanwhile, Jarrett is dealing with a knee injury from Monday’s loss to the Vikings. Wednesday’s injury report is an estimate, so Bears fans can stay tuned later in the week to see if the defenders practice in time for Week 2.</description>

      <title>Bears RB Roschon Johnson (foot) was estimated as a limited participant in Wednesday’s walk-thru practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3637-d93a-abbb-7f7f06280000</link>
      <description>Johnson closed out last week with a limited practice after two DNPs, so starting out this week with a limited practice estimation indicates he is on his way back from a foot injury. Kyle Monangai is currently the backup to D’Andre Swift, though he did not receive any carries Week 1. Johnson has had little production in two years in the league, but could provide handcuff value upon his return.</description>

      <title>Bears WR DJ Moore (abdomen/groin) and CB Jaylon Johnson (calf/groin) were estimated full participants in Wednesday’s walk-thru practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-363b-d332-a1fd-b63f5bd10000</link>
      <description>Moore took a big hit towards the end of the Bears’ Week 1 loss to the Vikings, giving fantasy managers concerns over his health status. He finished out the game and is now estimated as a full participant in Wednesday’s walk-thru, indicating he is good to go. Meanwhile, Johnson sat out Week 1 with his injuries and appears to be a step closer to returning with a full practice estimation on Wednesday.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (shoulder) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-363f-db7b-a5dd-b63f2e8a0000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Adam Schefter had reported yesterday that Jennings was “day-to-day” with a shoulder issue. The 28-year-old was hurt in the 49ers’ Week 1 win over the Seahawks, but and MRI did not show extensive damage to his shoulder. He starts out the week missing practice, putting his status to return immediately for Week 2 in jeopardy. With George Kittle on IR and Brock Purdy likely out, the 49ers are running out of fantasy-relevant offensive players early on in the season.</description>

      <title>49ers RB Christian McCaffrey (calf/rest) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3649-d332-a1fd-b67fd0a90000</link>
      <description>There’s a chance we see McCaffrey pop up with the calf/resting player designation several times throughout the season as the 49ers try to manage his workload and prevent aggravation of his prior calf injury. His limited practice last week had fantasy managers concerned, but he took on a large workload in the 49ers’ Week 1 win over the Seahawks. Expect McCaffrey to play in Week 2 while continuing to take on a large offensive workload with nearly every other offensive skill player hurt for the 49ers..</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Brock Purdy is expected to miss 2-5 weeks “with a turf toe variant.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-38c2-d3c5-a9f9-3cf7b77b0000</link>
      <description>Rapoport specifically said his “understanding is that Purdy is out 2-5 weeks.” We will likely get a more definite timeline from Kyle Shanahan in the coming days, but it sounds like Purdy is a near lock to miss Week 2’s game against the Saints and is also unlikely to play in Week 3 against the Cardinals. Purdy is reportedly dealing with a ligament injury that is affecting the bottom of his foot, and his absence will pave the way for Mac Jones to make his first start in a 49ers uniform since being acquired by the team this offseason. All fantasy expectations for all pass-catchers in the Niners’ offense should be scaled back a bit in Jones’ first start. However, Jauan Jennings’ (shoulder) Week 2 status is murky and George Kittle (hamstring) is on injured reserve, which could result in a busy day for Ricky Pearsall.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Todd Archer reports Cowboys CB DaRon Bland (foot) could miss multiple weeks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3938-d903-afbd-fdfc2fbd0000</link>
      <description>Bland suffered a right foot injury in Monday’s practice and was a DNP on Wednesday. Bland suffered a stress fracture to his left foot last season that required surgery and resulted in him missing seven games last season. Archer reports this new injury is not considered as serious as last year’s, which leads us to believe surgery is not on the table at this time. However, his Week 2 absence against the Giants could prove costly for a Cowboys secondary that is still working Trevon Diggs (27 snaps in Week 1) back into the mix. We’ll likely get an official word on Bland’s availability by the end of the week, but it’s possible a stint on the IR could be in his future if the team believes his recovery will stretch beyond four games.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Chris Godwin (ankle) is expected to practice in a limited capacity on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3940-d903-afbd-fdec78750000</link>
      <description>Godwin is recovering from a second surgery he underwent in the spring to repair some hardware he had put in his ankle. It was reported earlier that Godwin and the Bucs are targeting a Week 5 return, but Rapoport reports “Week 6 is also possible” as a return date. The Buccaneers made the decision to keep Godwin off injured reserve to start the season, and now appear ready to ramp him up for a return next month. If all goes well, Godwin is likely looking at multiple weeks of practice before he takes to the field. He avoided injured reserve to start the year, but there’s little reason to expect an early return, keeping the fantasy stocks for Mike Evans and rookie Emeka Egbuka high.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers beat writer Rick Stroud reports Tristan Wirfs (knee) is expected to practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3962-d903-afbd-fdee89160000</link>
      <description>Wirfs and Chris Godwin (ankle) are both making their practice debuts on Thursday as the team plans to ramp them up for a return. Wirfs underwent knee surgery in July but avoided a stay on short-term IR to open the season, indicating he could have a shot at returning before Week 5 if all goes well. Second-year lineman Graham Barton drew the Week 1 start against the Falcons in Wirfs’ absence and allowed three pressures and three hurries, on 38 pass-blocking snaps, per PFF. Wirfs will likely practice in a limited capacity on Thursday and seems unlikely to play in Week 2 against the Texans.</description>
