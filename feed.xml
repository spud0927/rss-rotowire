      <title>Panthers HC Dave Canales said Jalen Coker has a “significant quad strain.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0606-dbe3-a9bb-36575fce0000</link>
      <description>Coker has already been placed on injured reserve and will miss at least the first four games of the season. However, Canales’ most recent comments suggest the second-year receiver could be looking at an absence that extends beyond the four-game minimum. The Panthers re-signed Hunter Renfrow late last week, giving them an easy replacement for Coker in the slot, but we wouldn’t expect Renfrow to have much fantasy upside at this time. We will provide any additional updates on Coker as they come available.</description>

      <title>Browns CB Greg Newsome said his shoulder “feels amazing” after being limited due to the injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0616-db7b-a5dd-a61631cc0000</link>
      <description>Newsome was limited throughout most of training camp due to his shoulder injury, but the veteran corner says the shoulder “will not be a factor” as he prepares for Week 1’s game against the Bengals. Newsome was once thought to be a cap casualty by the Browns this offseason, but remains on the roster and is expected to play a key role as the team’s second corner opposite Denzel Ward. Newsome, 25, totaled 27 tackles and one interception in 13 games for the Browns last season.</description>

      <title>Tyreek Hill (oblique) is expected to play in Week 1 against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0622-d332-a1fd-963682e80000</link>
      <description>This doesn’t come as much of a surprise after the team said last week that the star receiver “looks great” for the team’s season opener. Hill was reportedly participating in Monday’s practice, but we’ll have a better sense of his availability when the first practice report is released on Wednesday. Assuming he’s active, Hill should profile as a fringe WR1/WR2 against a Colts secondary that allowed the seventh-most passing yards per game last season.</description>

      <title>Cade Otton (leg) is practicing on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0649-de13-afdd-46cb65690000</link>
      <description>It’s not exactly a guarantee that Otton will avoid missing this week’s game against the Falcons — Todd Bowles said he’d be “out for a little bit” last week — but it is a step in the right direction. The injury reports starting Wednesday will tell the tale of Otton’s Week 1 status better than this report does. Sean Tucker also returned to practice per Stroud.</description>

      <title>Cowboys LT Tyler Guyton (knee) believes he will play against the Eagles in Week 1.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-064c-dbe3-a9bb-365f71810000</link>
      <description>Nothing has been decided yet. The teams have not put up an injury report yet, but Guyton seems to have a chance to shake his injury off ahead of the 4-6 week timeline. Guyton went down with what was feared to be a torn ACL but wound up as “merely” a bone fracture in his knee in late July and has not participated in the preseason.</description>

      <title>Jaguars coach Liam Coen said the coaching staff is still evaluating Travis Hunter’s usage in Week 1.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0667-de13-afdd-46ef5d230000</link>
      <description>The question asked was if Hunter would start on both sides of the ball. Coen emphasized that they’re working through it and he “missed a lot of time” with his upper body injury. This isn’t necessarily a fantasy football fire alarm, but it does sound like Hunter’s preseason injury should have us with slightly lowered expectations for Week 1.</description>

      <title>Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said S C.J. Gardner-Johnson (knee) is expected to play in Week 1 against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-066c-db7b-a5dd-a66c0fe20000</link>
      <description>Gardner-Johnson went down in early August with a knee injury that was expected to threaten his season, but Gardner-Johnson has been able to rehab it successfully and it thankfully was not as bad as it initially looked. Gardner-Johnson should have a decent role in Houston this year, though Jalen Pitre is probably the IDP Texans back-seven player you want to roster.</description>

      <title>Jauan Jennings (calf) was seen practicing on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-063d-d332-a1fd-963ff21e0000</link>
      <description>The Niners don’t need to release an official practice report until Wednesday, but a Monday return in any capacity is good news for Jennings, who has been dealing with a calf injury since late July. General manager John Lynch said last week that the team is “hopeful” Jennings could return for Week 1 against the Seahawks, but didn’t sound overly optimistic. Jennings’ status will be one to monitor on Wednesday for when the first practice report is released.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports it is still “uncertain” if Packers EDGE Micah Parsons (back) will play in Week 1.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-067e-d332-a1fd-967e4a6b0000</link>
      <description>Schefter said that Parsons may need an epidural prior to the game and that the star rusher has been dealing with an “L4/L5 facet joint sprain” in his back. We don’t really know how much stock to put into this given Parsons said he’s feeling great on Friday — it almost reads like a Cowboys source dumping what they know to make the trade look better because of the details on what the Cowboys wanted Parsons to do. It does sound like perhaps the idea that Parsons’ back injury was pure cover-up is off-base. Parsons practiced in what appeared to be a limited basis today per ESPN’s Rob Demovsky.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Nick Wagoner believes 49ers WR Jordan Watkins (ankle) “doesn’t seem too far off.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0695-db7b-a5dd-a695f9050000</link>
      <description>But, he adds, the team might place Watkins on IR to make room for Kendrick Bourne if Bourne ends up signing with the 49ers. It sounds like Watkins has missed his chance to make a fantasy impact piece early in the season either way, but he’s still worth monitoring in dynasty leagues after making a lot of noise early in training camp.</description>
