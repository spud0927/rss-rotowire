      <title>Patriots activated WR Mack Hollins (abdomen) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f153-d56e-afff-f7fb21150000</link>
      <description>Hollins makes his return from injured reserve in time to face the Broncos in the AFC Championship game, likely returning to a semi-featured role due to his run-blocking abilities. It is likely we see undrafted free agent Efton Chism the odd man out due to Hollins’ return, with DeMario Douglas and Kyle Williams joining Hollins, Stefon Diggs, and Kayshon Boutte as the active wide receivers come Sunday. Hollins’ red zone acumen and deep-threat abilities warrant consideration in DFS on the short slate.</description>

      <title>Dolphins promoted senior passing game coordinator Bobby Slowik to offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f1df-d35e-a1bf-f5dfeabc0000</link>
      <description>Slowik drew fleeting interest in the offensive coordinator market after a failed stint in the same position with the Texans, interviewing with the Eagles and Dolphins for their respective vacancies. He ultimately remained with the Dolphins following a year as their senior passing game coordinator, giving the Kyle Shanahan protege his second look at play calling duties at the professional level.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports former Steelers OC Arthur Smith is expected to accept the same position at Ohio State.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e8f0-d35e-a1bf-edf255760000</link>
      <description>Alrighty then. The former Titans OC and Falcons head coach had been riding the NFL interview circuit, meeting with clubs about both head-coaching and play-calling vacancies, but evidently wasn’t gaining the traction he hoped for. He now (reportedly) heads to what has become a coaching turnaround factory in Columbus, somewhat hilariously forming a coordinating tandem with Matt Patricia. 43-year-old Smith has extremely limited NCAA experience aside from low-level, one-year stints at UNC and Ole Miss. It’s not an amazing hire on paper, but talent trumps all at OSU. Smith will have enough of it to be positioned for success.</description>

      <title>The Titans have requested permission to interview Texans DBs coach Dino Vasso for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f289-d35e-a1bf-f7cb6ecb0000</link>
      <description>Texans DC Matt Burke is reportedly pushing for Vasso to get the promotion. It’s unclear if Vasso would actually get to call plays under defensive-minded head coach Robert Saleh, but it would inarguably be a promotion. 38-year-old Vasso has been bouncing around NFL coaching staffs since 2013, starting under Andy Reid in Kansas City.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Browns interviewed Commanders run game coordinator and Anthony Lynn for their head coaching vacancy on Saturday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f53b-dc7a-af9b-ffbfb7020000</link>
      <description>Lynn met with the Cleveland brass on Saturday night in Florida. He spoke with the Bills about their head coaching vacancy earlier in the day. Lynn spent four years as the Chargers’ head coach, going 33-31 with one playoff victory. He worked in Detroit as their OC for a year after that. Lynn is respected in league circles but doesn’t fit the archetype of the young offensive wunerdkind that most teams are looking for these days. Still, he could get a second chance at leading a team, particularly in Cleveland, where several candidates have already pulled out of the running.</description>

      <title>Titans requested an interview with Falcons defensive pass-game coordinator Mike Rutenberg for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f546-dc7a-af9b-ffff66b10000</link>
      <description>Rutenberg worked under new Titans boss Robert Saleh in New York as the team’s linebackers coach. He had previously worked with him in San Francisco before Saleh brought him to the Jets. The Falcons finished 13th in EPA per dropback allowed and 12th in passing yards per game allowed. The solid season in Atlanta and his ties to Saleh make Rutenberg the favorite to land Tennessee’s DC gig.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Bo Nix (ankle) “is expected to be sidelined 12 weeks.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f562-d56e-afff-f7ea3c550000</link>
      <description>Nix’s broken ankle was devastating news for the Broncos as they came out of the Divisional Round. The silver lining is that he should be ready for the team’s offseason program and the injury is not expected to be a long-term issue. According to Schefter, “The recovery, not the surgery, is thought to be the most challenging part of this injury.” Nix will not be able to put weight on his ankle for a month, putting to bed any notion of a Super Bowl miracle. Jarrett Stidham will draw the start in the AFC Championship game versus the Patriots. He will also start in the Super Bowl if the Broncos win today.</description>

      <title>Packers hired former Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon as defensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f57f-dc7a-af9b-ffffecce0000</link>
      <description>Gannon lasted three years as the Cardinals’ head coach before the team fired him at the end of the 2025 season. Gannon’s defenses finished 31st, 15th, and 29th in points allowed. While the Cardinals undoubtedly lacked talent on Gannon’s side of the ball, his inability to string two decent seasons together on defense was one of the many reasons Arizona showed him the door. Gannon is replacing Jeff Hafley, who was hired as the Dolphins’ head coach. The hope is that with a full cupboard on defense, headlined by Micah Parsons, Gannon will get better results in Green Bay.</description>

      <title>Giants interviewed Dolphins wide receivers coach Robert Prince for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f5b6-dc7a-af9b-ffbf820f0000</link>
      <description>Prince has held the position of wide receivers coach across three teams since 2021. He has bounced between the college and pro ranks for over 30 years. Prince has received multiple offensive coordinator interviews over the years but has never filled that role for an NFL team. As USA Today’s Art Stapleton notes, Prince could be hired by the Giants in another role, even if they go in a different direction at OC.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f5b6-dc7a-af9b-ffbf820f0000</guid>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports “multiple league sources consider Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak a prime candidate” for the Raiders’ head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f5c5-d56e-afff-f7ed802c0000</link>
      <description>Fowler also named Broncos pass-game coordinator Davis Webb as a “viable option,” according to his sources. With a handful of names already off the board for this hiring cycle, Kubiak is widely considered the top candidate left standing. He is the play-caller for the No. 3 offense in scoring and has experience under Kyle Shanahan, plus his father Gary Kubiak. Webb has only been coaching for three years and has held his current role for one season. He will likely need to gain some experience as an offensive coordinator before a team takes a chance on him as a head coach.</description>
