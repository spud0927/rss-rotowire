      <title>Cardinals ruled out CB Will Johnson (back/hip) for Week 11 against the 49ers.</title>

      <description>Johnson and LB Baron Browning (concussion) remained sidelined all week. The team is also without LB Mack Wilson (ribs). The three defenders will be missed against the 49ers, whose offensive health is improving. Both QB Brock Purdy (toe) and WR Ricky Pearsall (knee) will return to action this week.</description>

      <title>Raiders WR Tyler Lockett (knee) practiced fully on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-848f-d673-a39e-a49fb4910000</link>
      <description>The savvy, old wide receiver was back at it, practicing in full on Friday. Raiders head coach Pete Carroll has let Lockett play ahead of rookie WR Jack Bech, and that will likely continue this week against the Cowboys on Monday night. Lockett barely warrants FLEX consideration despite the soft matchup.</description>

      <title>North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick has “not and will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8492-d673-a39e-a49358670000</link>
      <description>On Friday, Belichick released a statement on social media addressing “circulating rumors” linking him to the Giants’ vacant head coaching job. Although Belichick has “great respect and genuinely cares for the New York Giants organization and both the Mara and Tisch families,” his commitment to the UNC Football program has not wavered. The Tar Heels’ head coach’s “focus remains solely on continuing to improve this team,” developing its players and building a program that makes fans proud.</description>

      <title>Dolphins RB Ollie Gordon (ankle) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 11 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8549-d713-ad9e-ed5d8c910000</link>
      <description>Gordon practiced fully on Friday, which is good news. The rookie running back played behind RB Jaylen Wright in the Dolphins’ rotation last week, though Gordon was initially listed as questionable to play. This week should clarify which running back currently occupies the No. 2 spot. Neither one is terribly value as a bench stash, though.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports Bengals EDGE Shemar Stewart (knee) will be placed on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-85fd-d1e7-a1fa-dfff7f8b0000</link>
      <description>Stewart missed multiple games with an ankle injury and is now set to miss at least the next four games due to a knee injury. The 22-year-old defensive end will miss most of his rookie season due to injury and his play wasn’t anything to write home about when he was actually on the field. His 36.9 overall PFF grade was dead last among 114 defensive ends.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Patriots DT Milton Williams (ankle) could miss multiple weeks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8859-d673-a39e-acd9ca160000</link>
      <description>Williams is dealing with a high-ankle sprain, according to Fowler. The typical recovery time of a high-ankle sprain is 3-6 weeks. Fowler didn’t give a firm timetable or mention the possibility of Williams going on injured reserve, which would keep him out for four games. At this point, it’s safe to assume Williams will miss at least 2-3 games and the Patriots’ run defense takes a significant hit without him.</description>

      <title>Broncos placed RB J.K. Dobbins (foot) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-88c7-d1e7-a1fa-daef5f7b0000</link>
      <description>The foot injury occurred on an illegal hip-drop tackle in the team’s Thursday Night Football game against the Raiders in Week 10. The injury reportedly requires surgery, likely ending Dobbins’ season. Dobbins ranked fifth in the league in rushing prior to the injury while playing on a one-year, prove-it deal in Denver. The team is reportedly interested in bringing the veteran back on a renewed contract this offseason, although the injury could cloud the situation. Rookie RJ Harvey is in line to see an expanded role for the remainder of the season, although Jaleel McLaughlin remains on hand to soak up change of pace snaps on early downs and Tyler Badie should remain involved in passing situations.</description>

      <title>Lions placed TE Sam LaPorta (back) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8939-d673-a39e-adb9d54a0000</link>
      <description>The veteran tight end will now miss the next four games, at minimum, as he tends to a back injury. Fantasy managers got little notice of the injury, with the first time hearing about it occurring when he missed practice Wednesday. Things escalated quickly as he was ruled out for the team’s Week 11 game on Friday and placed on injured reserve Saturday. Brock Wright is listed as questionable against the Eagles for Sunday Night Football, but he would stand to benefit from LaPorta’s absence. Realistically, boost the volume expectation of Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams for the immediate future.</description>

      <title>Bills elevated WR Gabe Davis from the practice squad for Week 11 against the Bucs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8cab-d713-ad9e-ecffda240000</link>
      <description>This is noteworthy because the Bills are in need of a shakeup in their wide receiver room. Davis has been rehabbing from offseason knee surgery but reportedly looks like himself in practice. The veteran is only 26 years old and averaged essentially 800 yards and seven touchdowns in his last two healthy seasons. Josh Allen obviously trusts Davis, so he could be worth a stash in deeper formats just in case he becomes the big play threat in Buffalo again.</description>

      <title>Bills signed WR Mecole Hardman from the practice squad to the active roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8cb1-d45b-affe-ddb70c430000</link>
      <description>In order to make room on the active roster, the Bills released KR/PR Brandon Codrington which seems to signal that Hardman will primarily be used as a return man in Buffalo. The Bills could also use Hardman on som gadget routes but they have Elijah Moore and Curtis Samuel in that role as well. For now, Hardman remains off fantasy radars.</description>
