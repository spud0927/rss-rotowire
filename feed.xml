      <title>Falcons elvated WR Chris Blair and EDGE Khalid Kareem from the practice squad for Week 17 against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6bd4-d35e-a1bf-6fd680990000</link>
      <description>Blair was also up for Week 16 against the Cardinals, and played nine total snaps. He’ll likely see a similiar amount of playing time Monday against Los Angeles.</description>

      <title>Bills coach Sean McDermott said Josh Allen (foot) is “dealing with some soreness” and is “maybe in a slightly better spot” than he was last week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6bf6-d968-a19b-7bf711da0000</link>
      <description>McDermott said that it is “too early in the week” to share who is playing and who is not against the Jets. Buffalo can finish as high as the No. 5 seed, but would only host a playoff game if chaos ensued in the AFC bracket. They also are probably a fair bet to beat the Jets even with some backups on the field. Allen’s status sounds like it’s yet to be fully determined, but if the Bills do decide to play him, fantasy managers shouldn’t have any hesitation jamming in the lineup beyond the fact that he could get pulled early.</description>

      <title>Texans activated WR Justin Watson (Achilles) off injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6bf2-dc7a-af9b-efff52330000</link>
      <description>Watson will get his first chance to play since being placed on injured reserve in the middle of September. The 29-year-old wideout will be a depth piece for the finale against the Colts and Houston’s postseason run. Solomon Byrd was waived to make room on the roster.</description>

      <title>Bills coach Sean McDermott said Terrel Bernard (calf) will not play in Buffalo’s Week 18 game against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6bfa-dc7a-af9b-efff5f4d0000</link>
      <description>It doesn’t bode well for his playoff status either. Bernard left Week 17’s game against the Eagles and was questionable to return, but never did. Bernard has only played in 11 games this year while dealing with a number of injuries. He has 65 tackles and three passes defensed.</description>

      <title>Chargers HC Jim Harbaugh told reporters that Justin Herbert (hand) will not start in Week 18 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6bfa-dc7a-af9b-efffe75d0000</link>
      <description>Herbert took a beating against the Texans in Week 16 and looked to be in significant pain at the end of that contest, and the Chargers don’t have much to play for in the finale before the playoffs. It’ll likely be Trey Lance starting against Denver, and his dual-threat ability makes his an intriguing — but risky — fantasy play for that finale.</description>

      <title>Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said Marvin Harrison (heel) “hurt his other foot” in Week 17’s loss and will play in Week 18 “if he is healthy enough to play.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c18-d56e-afff-eef8a5190000</link>
      <description>It certainly seems like forcing Harrison to play through this heel injury isn’t helping anybody — he’s caught one ball in two games since returning, leaving each of them early — but Gannon refused to rule it out. Either way, Trey McBride and Michael Wilson are the Cardinals you actually want to start in fantasy leagues in Week 18. Harrison would be hard to trust if active.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said he doubts that Pete Carroll will be the Raiders head coach in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c1e-d56e-afff-eefe44530000</link>
      <description>It’s sort of jammed in to the end of a Bluesky video about the Raiders future, but Rapoport brings up the idea of Fernando Mendoza being the future of the franchise should they finish their tank successfully against the Chiefs and says “We’ll see if Pete Carroll is there for it, I doubt it, but we’ll see.” It would be hard to blame the Raiders for pulling the plug after this disastrous season, but Carroll would be their second-straight one-and-done head coach.</description>

      <title>Packers claimed DL Jonathan Ford off waivers from the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c09-d35e-a1bf-6dcbba830000</link>
      <description>The Packers are hurting in depth, so they’ll turn to Ford; a player that spent 2022-2024 with Green Bay before joining Chicago.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c09-d35e-a1bf-6dcbba830000</guid>

      <title>Colts signed QB Seth Henigan to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c2f-dc7a-af9b-efbf8d910000</link>
      <description>Henigan, 22, could be the emergency third quarterback for Week 18 against the Texans. The former Memphis signal-caller went undrafted in 2025 and spent most of the season in the Jaguars’ system.</description>

      <title>Kurtis Rouke (knee) will remain on the non-football injured list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c34-d56e-afff-eefc5cb50000</link>
      <description>Rourke was not activated off the NFI list before the Week 18 game against the Seahawks. The 2025 seventh-round pick will compete for a backup spot in 2026.</description>
