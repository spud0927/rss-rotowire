      <title>Broncos elevated TE Marcedes Lewis from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-411d-d673-a39e-e59d94f70000</link>
      <description>Lewis needs four appearances to get credit for his 20th season in the NFL, meaning he would need to be signed to the active roster at some point considering teams are allowed to elevate a player only three times from the practice squad. He starts that journey in Week 9 after his first of three standard elevations.</description>

      <title>Ravens traded CB Jaire Alexander to the Eagles in pick swap.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-411f-d45b-affe-559feaf10000</link>
      <description>Alexander heads to his third team in a calendar year as the Eagles continue hoarding talent, with the team sending a 2026 sixth-round pick to the Ravens for Alexander and a seventh. Howie Roseman is no stranger to taking a cheap gamble on underperforming talent, which appears to be the case yet again with the recent addition. Alexander could compete with backup corner Kelee Ringo immedaitely considering the absence of Adoree’ Jackson.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Cooper Kupp (heel/hamstring) is unlikely to play in Week 9 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44ad-d1e7-a1fa-5eef51b00000</link>
      <description>Kupp appeared on the first injury report of the week with the heel issue but managed a full practice. He was then downgraded to a limited session on Thursday after suffering the hamstring issue in practice. The team eventually listed him as questionable, though he always seemed like a long shot to suit up today after going down with a mid-week injury. Fellow Seattle wideouts Jake Bobo and Dareke Young have also been ruled out. Cody White and Ricky White were elevated off the team’s practice squad this week. They will be competing for the No. 3 gig behind Tory Horton. This all, of course, just means more targets for Jaxson Smith-Njigba, who enters the week as a WR1 overall contender.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Vikings LT Christian Darrisaw (knee) is expected to play in Week 9 against the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44b4-d45b-affe-55b653b90000</link>
      <description>Right tackle Brian O’Neill is also expected to suit up. Both of Minnesota’s starting tackles were listed as questionable on Friday, creating the possibility for J.J. McCarthy to return to the lineup with two backup tackles. Though we still expect Aidan Hutchinson to be an issue for McCarthy, the good news is that his line will make it a fair fight.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44b4-d45b-affe-55b653b90000</guid>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “teams have inquired to the Seahawks about the availability of” EDGE Boye Mafah and CB Riq Woolen.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44b9-d713-ad9e-6cfd31ab0000</link>
      <description>Both defenders are members of the Seahawks’ 2022 draft class, meaning they are headed for free agency in the spring. Woolen broke out as a rookie, but his play has slowly declined ever since. He is one of the few Seattle defenders who hasn’t found success in Mike Macdonald’s offense. Mafe totaled nine sacks in 2023 and six in 2024. He doesn’t have a sack this year and is stuck in a part-time role. A new home may be best for both players, and the Seahawks could get some extra draft capital for them instead of watching the duo walk in free agency.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Bills, Cowboys, and Colts have “expressed some interest” in Bengals LB Logan Wilson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44c0-d673-a39e-e4d11a500000</link>
      <description>Schefter also noted that a loss today could make the Bengals more inclined to trade EDGE Trey Hendrickson, though that move still seems like a long-shot. Wilson’s role has been on the decline in recent weeks with Demetrius Knight Jr. and Barrett Carter playing ahead of him. He was largely tasked with special teams duties in Week 8 and is now dealing with a calf issue. The 3-5 Bengals clearly don’t have much use for Wilson at this point, so a trade would make sense for both sides. A move to Indy, in particular, would make sense, as it would reunite Wilson with long-time Bengals defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Alvin Kamara (ankle) is expected to play in Week 9 against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44ca-d45b-affe-55de31050000</link>
      <description>Kamara has been dealing with the ankle issue for a few weeks. He appeared to aggravate the injury in Week 8’s loss to the Bucs but managed three limited practices during the week. Head coach Kellen Moore was optimistic about him suiting up as of Friday. Kamara has been losing work to his backups more often this year and his efficiency has fallen off the map. As a massive underdog to the Rams this week, he barely registers as an RB3.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Rashid Shaheed (hip) is expected to play in Week 9 against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44cc-d45b-affe-55de0d440000</link>
      <description>Shaheed injured his hip late in the Saints’ Week 8 loss to the Bucs. He was limited in practice throughout the week before being given a questionable designation. With Tyler Shough making his first start this week, Shaheed has no floor to offer fantasy managers, despite the Saints likely needing to pass early and often to hang with the Rams. He remains a boom/bust WR4 for Week 9.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Dalton Schultz (knee/shoulder) is expected to play in Week 9 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44d2-d673-a39e-e4d36eab0000</link>
      <description>Schultz looked truly questionable for Week 9 after missing practice on Wednesday and Thursday. He returned for a full practice on Friday, putting him in line to play despite the questionable tag. Schultz managed just two catches for 24 yards with Nico Collins out last week. Collins and Christian Kirk are back in the lineup, meaning Schultz’s target share will likely take a hit versus Denver. He is a low-ceiling TE2 for Week 9.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44d2-d673-a39e-e4d36eab0000</guid>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes “a potential benching is not off the table at some point this season” for Tua Tagovailoa.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-44d6-d713-ad9e-6cd64ba30000</link>
      <description>Rapoport doesn’t cite any sources, but it’s hard to argue with his speculation. Tagovailoa leads the league with 11 interceptions and the Dolphins are all but out of the playoff hunt with a 2-7 record. The team has Zach Wilson as his backup and rookie Quinn Ewers waiting in the wings. As Rapoport points out, the Dolphins would take on a record-setting cap hit of $114.2 million if they cut Tua next offseason. They could spread it out between 2026 and 2027 via a post-June 1st designation, but it will be painful no matter how the accounting is done. Miami could also trade Tagovailoa, though they would still need to eat a large portion of his contract before any team considers buying the damaged goods. Either way, all signs point to a split between Tua and Miami sooner rather than later.</description>
