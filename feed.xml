      <title>The Athletic’s Zac Jackson believes Shedeur Sanders will get “runway to be the No. 1 quarterback for the summer and early fall.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4909-d042-afbc-7ddb17c90000</link>
      <description>To be clear, this doesn’t mean that Sanders is the long-term starter for the Browns — in fact, Jackson even says they’re probably looking at drafting another quarterback “fairly early” in this year’s draft. But it seems like the team is mostly playing its cards as if they’re getting ready for 2027, not 2026, with Deshaun Watson as “a fallback option because he has to be.” That should give Shedeur Sanders a chance to start in 2026 — he’ll need to do better than he did towards the end of 2025 to keep the job, however, incredibly funny Pro Bowl nod aside.</description>

      <title>Jets hired former Browns quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave as their quarterbacks coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4915-d89c-a1be-efdf639a0000</link>
      <description>Musgrave has coordinator experience with the Panthers, Jaguars, Vikings, Raiders, and Broncos. The 58-year-old has not called NFL plays since 2018 and has spent the last three years with the Browns. He’ll be another voice in Frank Reich’s room as the Jets try to turn their offense away from the abyss.</description>

      <title>Raiders coach Klint Kubiak said he wants EDGE Maxx Crosby “to be a part of our success going forward, there’s no doubt about that.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4919-d89c-a1be-efdf5cd00000</link>
      <description>This is mostly cold water on the idea of a Crosby trade from the team’s new head coach, but we’ll see what happens going forward here. There have been too many reports of Crosby wanting out — including one of him telling Tom Brady he’d never play for the Raiders again — to fully invest in the idea that a trade won’t happen. Still, it’s broadly good news that Crosby was at the introductory presser and had coffee with Kubiak.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Josh Kendall believes franchise-tagging Kyle Pitts “makes the most sense” for the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-492d-d89c-a1be-efffc9dc0000</link>
      <description>Kendall notes that he believes Pitts is “likely to remain in Atlanta” either way, but that with the new executives and head coaches mostly not commenting on him, it would give everyone a year involved to see how good Pitts can be in Kevin Stefanski’s offense. The franchise tag for tight ends is not exorbitant, and Kendall notes that Pitts’ agent would likely ask for at least the tag (a little over $16.3 million) in average annual value anyway.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Josh Kendall believes Drake London “could get a new deal this offseason.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4931-d355-a5bd-cf75ec0c0000</link>
      <description>Kendall notes that new GM Ian Cunningham proactively gave an extension to DJ Moore in Chicago, and writes that “getting the deals done sooner rather than later should be the team’s approach.” London enters 2026 on his fifth-year option and is scheduled to make $16.8 million. An extension would obviously make plenty of sense after London established himself as one of the best receivers in the NFL over the past two seasons despite inconsistent quarterback play. Kendall believes London “likely sees himself” as a $30 million a year player.</description>

      <title>Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza said he’s a “huge fan” of Klint Kubiak.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-493f-d042-afbc-7dffcd540000</link>
      <description>“Throughout this entire season, we actually had a little bit of a Kubiak-[Sean] McVay system, not for our RPO system but our play-action,” Mendoza told reporters in San Francisco during Super Bowl week. “The way [Kubiak] is able to incorporate outside zone and get the edge with the run game, where the running back can collect the edge, hit the hole or cut back and do play-action off of that, and the way he has developed Sam Darnold has been phenomenal,” Mendoza noted. Not that we needed a whole lot of convincing that this would eventually happen, but it sure sounds like Mendoza is excited by his likely fate to be a Raider with the No. 1 overall pick.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers OC Zac Robinson said he sees Bucky Irving “in a very similar light [to Bijan Robinson] there with what he can do in the passing game.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4943-d89c-a1be-efdfcf720000</link>
      <description>“There’s not a run concept that he can’t run,” Robinson said. It was certainly a disappointing 2025 season between injury and an inability to stick on the field in the red zone, but Irving appears to be entering 2026 as the lead back for an offensive coordinator who believes in him. And with Rachaad White a free agent, to boot, it seems likely that Irving is primed for a 2026 rebound.</description>

      <title>RT Rob Havenstein retired from the NFL after 11 seasons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4967-d89c-a1be-efff77fa0000</link>
      <description>He announced it on his Instagram. Havenstein started 148 games over 11 years with the Rams as their main right tackle, playing in two Super Bowls and winning one. The stalwart protector struggled with injuries over the past couple of seasons and couldn’t suit up for the Rams after Week 11 of the 2025 season. He had a 70 or higher PFF grade in nine of his 11 years and, while he likely isn’t a real Hall of Fame candidate, he was an incredibly successful pick by the Rams who should have a shot at some Ring Of Honor-type recognition.</description>

      <title>New Raiders coach Klint Kubiak said he’ll call plays for the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4986-d042-afbc-7dd6e3bf0000</link>
      <description>As expected. He dressed it up by saying it would be a collaborative effort with the staff, but them being part of the game plan wasn’t going to stop the offensive mind from getting to use his difference-making ability as a playcaller. Kubiak should be ready to call plays for his new quarterback (obviously Fernando Mendoza) in 2026 after helping pull the best out of Sam Darnold en route to a Super Bowl win.</description>

      <title>Commanders signed P Tress Way to a one-year contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-498f-d042-afbc-7ddffe120000</link>
      <description>Way made his third Pro Bowl this past year and allowed a career-low 114 return yards. Entering his age-36 season, he’s been with the Commanders since 2014.</description>
