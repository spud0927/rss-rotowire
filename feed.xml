      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports that Broncos RB J.K. Dobbins will not play in Week 11 against the Chiefs and could be placed on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-846b-d673-a39e-a4fbfb720000</link>
      <description>Rapoport ambiguously states that Dobbins “is believed to be out for the foreseeable future” as he works through his options regarding his injured foot. Dobbins was injured while being hip-drop tackled by a Raiders defender in Week 10. Broncos rookie RB RJ Harvey steps into lead back duties with Dobbins sidelined, while receiving specialist RB Tyler Badie chips in behind him. Fellow backup RB Jaleel McLaughlin will likely be active on game day.</description>

      <title>Broncos ruled out CB Pat Surtain II (pec) for Week 11 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8468-d673-a39e-a4f95a690000</link>
      <description>Surtain has been out since injuring his pec in Week 8. The Broncos will also be without LB Alex Singleton, who recently underwent a successful procedure to remove a tumor, and LB Jonah Elliss (hamstring). These are tough losses for a defense tasked with containing the Chiefs’ offense, but the unit as a whole remains strong.</description>

      <title>Broncos WR Marvin Mims (concussion) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 11 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8477-d45b-affe-d5f7ab2d0000</link>
      <description>The Broncos get their erratically productive wide receiver back after a two-game absence. The Chiefs’ defense is very good, and Mims is hardly reliable, but this should be a fantasy-friendly game environment. Consider Mims a volatile FLEX option, reliant on a big play.</description>

      <title>Cardinals ruled out CB Will Johnson (back/hip) for Week 11 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8478-d45b-affe-d5feb2070000</link>
      <description>Johnson and LB Baron Browning (concussion) remained sidelined all week. The team is also without LB Mack Wilson (ribs). The three defenders will be missed against the 49ers, whose offensive health is improving. Both QB Brock Purdy (toe) and WR Ricky Pearsall (knee) will return to action this week.</description>

      <title>Raiders WR Tyler Lockett (knee) practiced fully on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-848f-d673-a39e-a49fb4910000</link>
      <description>The savvy, old wide receiver was back at it, practicing in full on Friday. Raiders head coach Pete Carroll has let Lockett play ahead of rookie WR Jack Bech, and that will likely continue this week against the Cowboys on Monday night. Lockett barely warrants FLEX consideration despite the soft matchup.</description>

      <title>North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick has “not and will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8492-d673-a39e-a49358670000</link>
      <description>On Friday, Belichick released a statement on social media addressing “circulating rumors” linking him to the Giants’ vacant head coaching job. Although Belichick has “great respect and genuinely cares for the New York Giants organization and both the Mara and Tisch families,” his commitment to the UNC Football program has not wavered. The Tar Heels’ head coach’s “focus remains solely on continuing to improve this team,” developing its players and building a program that makes fans proud.</description>

      <title>Dolphins RB Ollie Gordon (ankle) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 11 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8549-d713-ad9e-ed5d8c910000</link>
      <description>Gordon practiced fully on Friday, which is good news. The rookie running back played behind RB Jaylen Wright in the Dolphins’ rotation last week, though Gordon was initially listed as questionable to play. This week should clarify which running back currently occupies the No. 2 spot. Neither one is terribly value as a bench stash, though.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports Bengals EDGE Shemar Stewart (knee) will be placed on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-85fd-d1e7-a1fa-dfff7f8b0000</link>
      <description>Stewart missed multiple games with an ankle injury and is now set to miss at least the next four games due to a knee injury. The 22-year-old defensive end will miss most of his rookie season due to injury and his play wasn’t anything to write home about when he was actually on the field. His 36.9 overall PFF grade was dead last among 114 defensive ends.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Patriots DT Milton Williams (ankle) could miss multiple weeks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8859-d673-a39e-acd9ca160000</link>
      <description>Williams is dealing with a high-ankle sprain, according to Fowler. The typical recovery time of a high-ankle sprain is 3-6 weeks. Fowler didn’t give a firm timetable or mention the possibility of Williams going on injured reserve, which would keep him out for four games. At this point, it’s safe to assume Williams will miss at least 2-3 games and the Patriots’ run defense takes a significant hit without him.</description>

      <title>Broncos placed RB J.K. Dobbins (foot) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-88c7-d1e7-a1fa-daef5f7b0000</link>
      <description>The foot injury occurred on an illegal hip-drop tackle in the team’s Thursday Night Football game against the Raiders in Week 10. The injury reportedly requires surgery, likely ending Dobbins’ season. Dobbins ranked fifth in the league in rushing prior to the injury while playing on a one-year, prove-it deal in Denver. The team is reportedly interested in bringing the veteran back on a renewed contract this offseason, although the injury could cloud the situation. Rookie RJ Harvey is in line to see an expanded role for the remainder of the season, although Jaleel McLaughlin remains on hand to soak up change of pace snaps on early downs and Tyler Badie should remain involved in passing situations.</description>
