      <title>ESPN’s David Newton believes that unless Rico Dowdle “wants to return at a bargain price, he appears headed to his third team in three seasons.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1020-d424-a3fd-f738f7e30000</link>
      <description>Dowdle was notably down on how little he was used in the regular season finale and in the playoffs, where he rushed a combined 12 times for 19 yards, and said that would be a “factor” in his free agency. Dowdle’s fantasy stock could take a big upturn if he wound up being the obvious lead back on a new team this offseason. The Chiefs, Saints and Texans come to mind as (our speculation) possibilities. Chuba Hubbard’s stock would similarly rebound if Dowdle took off to greener pastures.</description>

      <title>Panthers coach Dave Canales said Jalen Coker “will enter the offseason as the No. 2 receiver” on the depth chart behind Tetairoa McMillan.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1027-d042-afbc-7df739c40000</link>
      <description>It’s not a surprise based on how last season ended — and how Coker blew up in the Wild Card loss to the Rams — but it’s good to get coach validation. Xavier Legette has struggled to grab hold of the role in any real way. While Coker finished the year with just a 33/394/3 line, he makes for an intriguing fantasy WR4/WR5 target in drafts and Best Ball.</description>

      <title>Drake Maye (illness) did not practice on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-102c-d355-a5bd-9f7c5f1e0000</link>
      <description>To be clear, Maye is still dealing with a shoulder injury, but head coach Mike Vrabel said Maye “would’ve been at practice today if not for the illness.” Maye had been limited in practice all week leading up to Friday, but the team doesn’t appear too concerned about his injury sidelining him in the Super Bowl, which is still over a week away.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Turron Davenport believes the Titans could use more run-pass options with Cam Ward in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1038-d042-afbc-7dfa7d600000</link>
      <description>Davenport points out that Brian Daboll ran RPOs on 12.6 percent of their plays last year, fourth-most in the league, and notes that Ward had a lot of success running them in college at Miami. We don’t know that Ward is an upper-tier NFL athlete in space, but every bit of rushing production could help him for fantasy football purposes. Perhaps being in a scheme he’s more familiar with could help as well. Ward, who sprained his AC joint in the Titans’ Week 18 loss to Jacksonville, does not currently have a timetable to return to the field but Titans GM Mike Borgonzi said he was “doing well.”</description>

      <title>Broncos completed an interview with Commanders assistant head coach and pass game coordinator Brian Johnson for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1061-d89c-a1be-bfff85340000</link>
      <description>Commanders head coach Dan Quinn brought Johnson aboard less than two weeks after being hired, back in February 2024. Johnson served as the Eagles’ quarterbacks coach from 2021-2022 before being promoted to offensive coordinator in 2023. Johnson took the same employment path at Florida before that, going from the quarterbacks coach in 2018-2019 to offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2020.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jordan Raanan reports former Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury is “expected to be in the mix” for the Giants offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1068-d355-a5bd-9f7cc0c20000</link>
      <description>Jim Bob Cooter and Alex Tanney will get interviews over the weekend, but Kingsbury is at the top of Raanan’s list in this article. Kingsbury interviewed for the Giants head coaching vacancy already, and though it would perhaps seem a strange fit with John Harbaugh, it’s possible that Kingsbury is running out of better non-Ravens options this offseason as the Chiefs, Lions, Chargers, Eagles, Buccaneers, Titans, Dolphins and Falcons have already all filled vacancies and the only unsettled head-coaching situations are in Las Vegas and Arizona.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Nate Taylor reports the Chiefs are “expected” to have a new starting running back for the 2026 season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-106e-d042-afbc-7dfe482e0000</link>
      <description>He drops this in a note about Kansas City’s lack of explosion in 2025, a year in which impending free agent Isiah Pacheco was not able to manage a single run of 20 or more yards. New OC Eric Bieniemy, per Taylor, “will be tasked with putting together the correct run-blocking scheme for the Chiefs.” With both Pacheco and Kareem Hunt impending free agents and only gadget back Brashard Smith under contract, this report is not much of a surprise. The Chiefs will likely contend for one of the better free agent backs in this class.</description>

      <title>The NFL is projecting the salary cap to increase from $279.2 million in 2025 to more than $300 million in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1061-d424-a3fd-f7795c910000</link>
      <description>The exact range is said to be $301.2 million to $305.7 million per club. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero notes that this is nearly $100 million more than the $208.2 million salary cap in 2022. The exact number will be finalized before free agency begins on March 11th.</description>

      <title>Packers signed GM Brian Gutekunst to a contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1081-d042-afbc-7dd300520000</link>
      <description>Terms were not announced, but this was the expected outcome even after Green Bay’s playoff meltdown against the Bears in the Wild Card round. Gutekunst has done a great job of getting a wide base of talent for the Packers, and finally shook the “lack of star power” haters with a fearless trade for Micah Parsons before the season. Now without a first-round pick, the Packers will hope they can build enough talent around Jordan Love and Parsons for the team to be trending in the right direction for next year’s playoffs.</description>

      <title>Lions GM Brad Holmes said that OC Drew Petzing will call plays in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-1085-d89c-a1be-bfdf1c160000</link>
      <description>Well, what he really said was “look, it’s his offense. It’s not something where he’s got to do something else or be like – this is his show, man.” Holmes praised Petzing’s “impressive” job calling plays despite Arizona’s personnel issues and noted that Petzing isn’t married to a system so much as a philosophy to “maximize personnel of what’s available.” We’re not totally sold on Petzing’s work in Arizona, but it’s clear that NFL decision makers saw it differently. How the Lions change schematically in Petzing’s view will be a very real question over the next six months.</description>
