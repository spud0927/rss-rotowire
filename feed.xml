      <title>Chargers hired Max McCaffrey as their new running backs coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7c71-d629-a1bc-fc7d87b90000</link>
      <description>McCaffrey is a former undrafted free agent NFL wide receiver who spent time with five different NFL teams. He joined the college coaching ranks as a wide receivers coach at Northern Colorado in 2020. He added offensive coordinator to his title in 2021 and held both roles for two seasons. McCaffrey joined the NFL coaching ranks as a member of former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel’s coaching staff in 2023, serving as an offensive assistant through the 2025 season. McCaffrey’s new role reunites him with McDaniel, who was hired as the Chargers’ offensive coordinator in January. 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey and Commanders WR Luke McCaffrey are Max’s younger brothers.</description>

      <title>Bengals signed CB Jalen Davis to a one-year contract extension through 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7cae-d042-afbc-7dfeff6c0000</link>
      <description>Davis broke up one pass and notched one interception last season. The Bengals also signed HB Kendall Milton to a one-year contract for the 2026 season. He has rushed twice in his career, totaling two yards.</description>

      <title>Cowboys released LB Logan Wilson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7cb1-d89c-a1be-ffffe0830000</link>
      <description>The Cowboys acquired Wilson via trade from the Bengals in early November and played his first game with the team in Week 11. During his time with the Cowboys, Wilson totaled 20 tackles, one pressure and one pass breakup. Wilson, 29, has decent odds of landing on a new team in free agency, though he may be best suited to a rotational role as a run defender. The Cowboys save $6.5 million by releasing him.</description>

      <title>Titans hired Tanzel Smart as their new assistant defensive line coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7cbf-d89c-a1be-ffffba320000</link>
      <description>Smart’s hiring reunites him with Titans head coach Robert Saleh. The two spent three seasons together with the Jets from 2021-2023. Smart won over Hard Knocks viewers in his final NFL season, vying for a roster spot during the Jets’ 2023 training camp. He entered the NFL’s coaching ranks last season, signing on as a defensive quality control assistant with the Cowboys.</description>

      <title>Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said QB Patrick Mahomes (knee) is “making progress every day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7d04-d042-afbc-7dd6bbc10000</link>
      <description>Per Reid, Mahomes is spending seven hours per day with Chiefs assistant athletic trainer and physical therapist Julie Frymyer. Reid notes that although rehab following a significant knee injury is “not going to be a pleasant thing,” Mahomes keeps showing up and Frymyer continues to challenge him and keeps him “on task.” The positive reports continue to trickle in for the veteran quarterback, who has a chance to be ready for Week 1.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports that Titans QB Cam Ward (shoulder) is “recovering well.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7dc8-d042-afbc-7dda60560000</link>
      <description>Ward suffered an AC joint sprain in his right, throwing shoulder late in the year. Ward has been doing “lower-body work” and is expected to resume throwing the football in March, roughly two-to-three weeks from now. Titans coaches are reportedly focused on correcting “some of the bad habits” Ward picked up last year by improving his “base.” We should have another update on Ward’s recovery in the next couple of weeks.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe believes the Browns could pursue Packers LT Rasheed Walker in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7d00-d042-afbc-7dd271e70000</link>
      <description>Last week, The Athletic’s Matt Schneidman said he believes Jordan Morgan will be the Packers’ starting left tackle next season, so today’s report makes sense. All five members of the Browns’ starting offensive line are set to enter free agency this offseason. Starting anew with Walker, a talented 26-year-old left tackle, could be a smart move.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports that the Dolphins do not want to trade away RB De’Von Achane and WR Jaylen Waddle.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7dd0-d042-afbc-7dd28bf40000</link>
      <description>This comes as no surprise. Achane, 24, and Waddle, 27, are core offensive players. The Dolphins recently released WRs Tyreek Hill and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and LB Bradley Chubb as they enter a youth-oriented rebuild. Wolfe echoed recent reports indicating that trade talks regarding QB Tua Tagovailoa and S Minkah Fitzpatrick could heat up at the NFL Scouting Combine.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports that the Dolphins do not want to trade away WR Jaylen Waddle.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7dd8-d990-a1de-7dde3c140000</link>
      <description>This does not mean that other teams will not try to acquire him and RB De’Von Achane, but Waddle is currently valued as a core player. The Dolphins’ new front office has already begun releasing veterans and hopes to trade others, as they begin an organizational reset. Waddle, 27, is still a quality No. 1 wide receiver who can help develop a new, young quarterback. Keeping him makes sense.</description>

      <title>The Kansas City Star’s Pete Sweeney reports that Jaguars RB Travis Etienne has “legitimate interest” in signing with the Chiefs in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7e2a-d990-a1de-7e6e2d340000</link>
      <description>Etienne will become an unrestricted free agent when free agency officially begins. This would be quite the fun pairing. The Chiefs’ offense, featuring RBs Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco, averaged just 4.2 yards per carry during the regular season, ranking 20th in the NFL. Adding an explosive player like Etienne would be a significant upgrade. Both Hunt and Pacheco are set to become free agents as well.</description>
