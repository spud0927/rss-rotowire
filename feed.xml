      <title>Packers LG Aaron Banks (groin) left Green Bay’s Week 3 game against the Browns and did not return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-72e9-dfde-a1bd-7eedea300000</link>
      <description>He played 31 snaps before leaving at halftime, which kicked Jordan Morgan inside and got Green Bay’s other right tackles on the field to replace the similarly-departed Tom. We wouldn’t be surprised if Banks spent some time on the injury report this week at the very least. Green Bay’s offensive line injuries helped contribute to a disappointing loss against the Browns.</description>

      <title>Commanders HC Dan Quinn said Jayden Daniels (knee) is still day-to-day.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-72ef-d1b3-a5dd-73ff31980000</link>
      <description>Quinn will provide another update on Wednesday when the Commanders take the field for their first practice of the week. The team has played Daniels’ availability somewhat close to the vest, calling him “truly day-to-day” last week, only to eventually rule him out before the weekend after he failed to practice all week. We don’t fully know the severity of Daniels’ injury, leaving us to trust what the team tells us while we monitor injury reports from afar. Daniels’ practice status will be one to watch when the first report is released on Wednesday.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Kris Rhim believes the Chargers may be forced to “lean on” Omarion Hampton in a way they “didn’t anticipate in 2025.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-72ee-d6a5-adff-f6ef52840000</link>
      <description>With Najee Harris seemingly done for the season with an Achilles tear, the Chargers did not rotate Hampton out of the game often in Week 3. Backup Hassan Haskins played just seven offensive snaps, and did not receive a carry on any of them, while Hampton played 68 of 86 snaps. The Chargers may sign a third back off their practice squad this week, but it stands to reason that they may not be rotating Hampton out very often despite Greg Roman’s insistence that they’d do so in Week 1. The story quotes Jim Harbaugh as saying that Hampton has “picked it up and taken it on his shoulders. We’re really lucky to have him.” Bottom line: Fantasy managers who dealt with Hampton’s ugly first two weeks may be in for a dream runout if he can stay healthy.</description>

      <title>Commanders placed S Will Harris (fibula) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-72f4-d6a5-adff-f6f5eb050000</link>
      <description>We don’t know how much time Harris is expected to miss, but the stint on injured reserve will require him to miss a minimum of four games. The Commanders already signed veteran safety Darnell Savage to provide added depth to the secondary.</description>

      <title>Panthers TE Ja’Tavion Sanders (ankle) has a high-ankle sprain and will miss “multiple weeks.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7303-d93f-ad9d-7bc738080000</link>
      <description>Replacement tight end Tommy Tremble will likely be a non-factor for fantasy purposes. This could funnel more targets towards Carolina’s wideouts, leaving the tree more condensed ahead of Week 4’s matchup with the Patriots. Perhaps it will turn into a smash spot for Hunter Renfrow, since the other non-Tetairoa McMillan targets have been wanting.</description>

      <title>Lions placed EDGE Marcus Davenport (chest) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7306-dfde-a1bd-7f8fcf9b0000</link>
      <description>Davenport reportedly couldn’t do much with his arm on Friday, up to and including working a lever on a recliner, so this is not a shock placement. The 29-year-old has been with the Lions in each of the last two seasons and the Vikings in 2023, and he has played just eight total games over that timespan. We often feel obligated to do the “he’ll miss at least the next four games” bit of the blurb, but that’s sort of just implied with Davenport.</description>

      <title>Texans placed S Jimmie Ward on the reserve/PUP list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-72fd-d1b3-a5dd-73fd6c990000</link>
      <description>According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Ward has been removed from the Commissioner Exempt List, but the league continues to review the allegations that led to Ward facing a $20 million civil lawsuit based on domestic abuse allegations. Ward has already missed the first three games of the season, and his placement on the reserve/PUP list will not change his roster status heading into Week 4.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Demarcus Robinson has been reinstated to San Francisco’s active roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-730b-d6a5-adff-f7cf9f590000</link>
      <description>The 49ers were so desperate for receiver help sans George Kittle and Brandon Aiyuk that Kendrick Bourne drew six targets in Week 3. We can’t quite say that Robinson has zero fantasy value in this situation, but we don’t think you’ll need a very high FAAB bid to secure his services for Week 4’s game against the Jaguars.</description>

      <title>Bears HC Ben Johnson said Jaylon Johnson will undergo core muscle surgery.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-730b-d6a5-adff-f7cfc0d90000</link>
      <description>Johnson didn’t rule out a possible return this season for his corner, but this surgery will likely land him on injured reserve for the foreseeable future. Johnson was injured in the Bears’ Week 1 loss to the Lions and hasn’t seen the field since, but his extended absence is bad news for a Bears secondary that has already struggled out of the gate.</description>

      <title>Chargers HC Jim Harbaugh confirmed Najee Harris suffered a torn Achilles in Week 3’s win over the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7323-d1b3-a5dd-73735a0c0000</link>
      <description>Harbaugh didn’t leave much to the imagination following Sunday’s game when he said preliminary tests indicated a torn Achilles for Harris, who went down on a non-contact play. It’s a season-ender for the 27-year-old running back whose 2025 challenges began with a fireworks accident on July 4th. Harris signed a one-year contract with the Chargers this offseason and sees his season come to an end with a 15-61-0 rushing line to go with three receptions for 25 scoreless yards. Harris will be a free agent this offseason and could be faced with having to sign a one-year prove-it deal wherever he lands next.</description>
