      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports that the Patriots are “shopping” S Kyle Dugger.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de1f-de13-afdc-dedf3fb00000</link>
      <description>Rapoport’s report backs up what Jordan Schultz reported on August 20. The Patriots’ new coaching staff is hoping to move on from Dugger. Earlier today, ESPN’s Mike Reiss reported that it has been a “challenging year” for Dugger, who underwent offseason ankle surgery and has played “deep into preseason games” this month.</description>

      <title>Lions released CB Dicaprio Bootle.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de17-d332-a1fd-de37c7200000</link>
      <description>Bootle, 27, was signed in the middle of July, and didn’t stick around past the summer. The speedy corner will now be free to sign with another team, but is likely just roster-fodder at this point.</description>

      <title>Broncos waived CB Micah Abraham.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de44-dbe3-a9bb-fe57c8830000</link>
      <description>Abraham suited up for two Broncos preseason games this year, allowing one catch for nine yards on two targets. He recorded zero tackles. The 2024 sixth-round pick will now look to make a final roster elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Jaguars traded T Fred Johnson to the Eagles in exchange for for a 2026 seventh-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de5b-d332-a1fd-de7ff04b0000</link>
      <description>Johnson returns to the Eagles after signing with the Jaguars in March. The 28-year-old will likely be a backup bookend for Philadelphia; a role that he served for the majority of the 2024 season with the club.</description>

      <title>Bills released RB Jarveon Howard.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de66-db7b-a5dd-fe6607700000</link>
      <description>Howard’s release comes with the designation of “failure to disclose condition,” which isn’t a common one. The 25-year-old could be a candidate for a practice squad, but it seems likely it won’t be with Buffalo.</description>

      <title>Packers acquired T Darian Kinnard from the Eagles in exchange for a 2027 sixth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de99-dbe3-a9bb-fedb6e7d0000</link>
      <description>It’s the third trade of the day for the Eagles, and the second involving a tackle. After re-acquiring Fred Johnson from the Jaguars, Kinnard become expendable, and instead he’ll serve in a similar capacity for Green Day.</description>

      <title>Courtland Sutton said he believes Marvin Mims is the Broncos’ No. 2 wide receiver.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-deb0-de13-afdc-defb241d0000</link>
      <description>Stuck in a part-time offensive role through two NFL seasons, Mims has teased excellent per-play efficiency, particularly as a post-catch producer. Sutton aptly notes that Mims “can make plays anywhere,” and his special teams returner showings have bagged him second- and first-team All-Pro honors. If Mims has indeed secured the No. 2 wide receiver role and will be allowed to remain on the field in two-wide receiver sets, we could see a breakout season from him in 2025. His PPR WR55, 13th-round ADP makes him a low-risk, high-reward draft pick.</description>

      <title>The San Francisco Standard’s Tim Kawakami reports, Jauan Jennings’ “lingering calf injury and long contractual stalemate with the 49ers could combine to send him to the injured reserve list this week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-dece-de13-afdc-decf483b0000</link>
      <description>Kawakami outlines multiple scenarios that could take place between now and Week 1, with frustration growing on both the 49ers’ and Jennings’ sides. Jennings is reportedly set to make $1.5 million guaranteed, and up to $3.5 million in performance incentives this year. Kawakami suggests the idea of an IR stint “could be a tacit threat to the Jennings camp.” Should they opt to make the move, it could also serve as “a nervous compromise and delay tactic for this increasingly tense situation.” This scenario is bad for all involved, though, as it limits their ability to bring back other players who are also injured. It’s entirely “possible nothing dramatic happens this week,” Jennings shows up for Week 1 with a healthy calf and all of this fades into the background. Still, the tense situation in San Francisco is worth noting. Regardless, for fantasy leagues with an injured reserve spot, Jennings looks like a sharp pick at his PPR WR46 ADP.</description>

      <title>Texans Insider Aaron Wilson reports RB Joe Mixon has had a “tough and complicated rehab.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e183-d332-a1fd-f7b7c2aa0000</link>
      <description>Speaking in a video on YouTube, Texans Insider Aaron Wilson said running back Joe Mixon had “multiple injections and electromagnetic therapy to remove scar tissue” in the early stages of a “tough and complicated rehab.” Wilson adds that Mixon’s recovery started off well before “sort of hitting a plateau,” before Mixon sought alternative treatment. Wilson ends by saying, “I just don’t think he’s ready. My hunch is that it may take more time.” It certainly sounds like those closest to the organization are not expecting Mixon on the field to start the season, backing up previous reports that he is a candidate for the PUP list to start the season.</description>

      <title>Dolphins waived CB Mike Hilton.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e1a4-db7b-a5dd-e1a4eda60000</link>
      <description>Hilton joined the Dolphins in late July but ultimately came up short of making the final 53. He played his previous four seasons with the Bengals, starting 23 games during the 2023 and 2024 seasons. The veteran has ample experience on both the perimeter and at nickel, meaning he could be claimed off waivers in short order.</description>
