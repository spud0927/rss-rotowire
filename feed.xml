      <title>Commanders coach Dan Quinn ruled Jayden Daniels (hamstring) out for Week 8.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1280-deb1-a39b-338ea0800000</link>
      <description>Quinn said the team would re-evaluate Daniels next week but wanted to see Marcus Mariota get as many practice reps as possible. The reports from earlier in the week were true, sadly. It does sound like Daniels has a chance to play in Week 9, but we’d start him on the questionable line for that week given how quick this rule-out came and the fact that he didn’t even try to test it in practice.</description>

      <title>Commanders coach Dan Quinn named Marcus Mariota the starting quarterback for Week 8’s game against the Chiefs.</title>

      <description>It’s not an enviable scenario for Mariota, but his legs and a profoundly negative game script should keep him on the QB2 radar in superflex leagues. It does appear that there’s at least a chance he’ll have Deebo Samuel (heel) and Terry McLaurin (quad) back, which should help him do better than he and Daniels did last week when the Commanders barely managed a functional passing offense against one of the worst pass defenses in the NFL in Dallas.</description>

      <title>Bears RB D’Andre Swift (groin) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1282-deb1-a39b-338ecc620000</link>
      <description>Swift is once again on track to play through a nagging soft tissue issue, though the injuries have not meaningfully impacted his productivity. The Bears’ running back has finished as the half-PPR RB6 and RB5, respectively, over the last two weeks. He can be safely expected to handle another fantasy-friendly workload against the Ravens this weekend. Bears No. 3 RB Roschon Johnson (back) remains sidelined.</description>

      <title>Bears WR DJ Moore (hip) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1278-dab4-a3fb-9b78e1760000</link>
      <description>Moore has finished in the WR3-WR5 range in every game this season. With six teams on bye this week, he has a chance to sneak back into the WR3 range for the first time since Week 3, however, considering him a WR4 is prudent. The Bears face a Ravens defense that yielded fantasy-friendly results pre-bye, in Weeks 1-6. The unit is enjoying improved health at the moment, which could make for slightly tougher sledding for Moore.</description>

      <title>Bills TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) was limited in Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1295-d245-adfb-97df95830000</link>
      <description>Back-to-back limited sessions have Kincaid trending towards playing in Week 8. If available, he’ll slot in as a low-end TE1 against the Panthers. Curtis Samuel (ribs) also was limited for a second-straight day and could be trending towards a return.</description>

      <title>Bills WR Josh Palmer (knee/ankle) did not practice Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1297-deb1-a39b-339f739f0000</link>
      <description>Deemed ‘week to week’ by Sean McDermott after Buffalo’s Week 6 game, Palmer has not made any moves yet towards being available for Week 8. Tyrell Shavers saw the most reps of the Buffalo’s backup receivers against the Falcons in Week 6 after Palmer left, but it wouldn’t be surprising if Elijah Moore or Curtis Samuel also played bigger roles in Week 8 against the Panthers.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1297-deb1-a39b-339f739f0000</guid>

      <title>Bears TE Cole Kmet (back) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1297-d5d8-a3ff-fbf7d1270000</link>
      <description>Kmet is on track to miss the Bears’ Week 8 game against the Ravens, which elevates rookie TE Colston Loveland to the top of the TE2 ranks. Loveland is worth adding if available. While his success is not guaranteed, these are the types of opportunities that can alter the course of a rookie season. The Ravens’ defensive health is improving, but this was a very fantasy-friendly unit before its Week 7 bye.</description>

      <title>Giants TE Daniel Bellinger (neck) was limited in Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-129e-d5d8-a3ff-fbff12770000</link>
      <description>Bellinger will be a TE2 if available, with Theo Johnson also a TE2 if Bellinger plays as Jaxson Dart has gone after his tight ends heavily. Johnson could upgrade if Bellinger sits, but that doesn’t look likely based on two limited practices for Bellinger on Wednesday and Thursday.</description>

      <title>Saints WR Chris Olave (ankle) resumed practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-129c-deb1-a39b-339ee51d0000</link>
      <description>New Orleans Football’s Nick Underhill reported yesterday that Olave is expected to play. Olave’s Thursday return affirms that. Whether this is a limited session or a full one, the Saints should have their target hog on the field for their Week 8 game against the Buccaneers. With six teams on bye, Olave profiles as a borderline WR1/2.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-129c-deb1-a39b-339ee51d0000</guid>

      <title>Giants WR Darius Slayton (hamstring) was limited in Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-12a1-dab4-a3fb-9bf15a1b0000</link>
      <description>Slayton talked to reporters in the locker room on Thursday, which is a good sign for him playing in Week 8 after missing Weeks 6 and 7 with this ailment. Back-to-back limited practices have us putting Slayton tentatively on the optimistic side of questionable heading into Friday’s practice. Slayton would be a viable FLEX play if he goes in Week 8, though spending time in the vicinity of Quinyon Mitchell might dampen some of his ceiling.</description>
