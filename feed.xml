      <title>Texans RB Woody Marks (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2e93-d1bc-a3fb-afb76edb0000</link>
      <description>Marks suffered an ankle injury during the Texans’ Week 15 win over the Cardinals and did not return with Houston holding a large lead. Head coach DeMeco Ryans said Monday that Marks should be fine, but the rookie begins the week not practicing. It could just be load management, but fantasy managers should roster Jawhar Jordan just in case. Jordan would share the backfield with Nick Chubb in the event Marks cannot go in Week 16 against the Raiders.</description>

      <title>Texans CB Derek Stingley (oblique) did not practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2e9b-d1bc-a3fb-afbff2c80000</link>
      <description>Though he has played in every game this season, Stingley dealt with the oblique issue early on and now misses the first practice of Week 16 because of it. The 24-year-old has played through it before and certainly can again with some practice time later this week. Fellow CB Kamari Lassiter (foot) also missed practice, though he played through the injury in Week 15. Stingley and Lassiter still have a good chance of playing Week 16 against the Raiders, though practice reports later in the week will provide a clearer picture.</description>

      <title>Rams WR Davante Adams (hamstring) is doubtful for Week 16 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2ea1-d77b-adfb-eea326130000</link>
      <description>Adams did not practice at all this week and is listed as doubtful for Thursday’s game against the Seahawks. He re-aggravated his hamstring injury on Sunday and returning on a short week was always going to be a tough task, despite the fact that Sean McVay refused to completely rule Adams out. Fantasy managers can expect to be without Adams for Week 16, boosting Puka Nacua even further and giving Colby Parkinson some viability in the red zone. The only other Ram listed on the team’s injury report is DE Braden Fiske, who is questionable with an ankle injury.</description>

      <title>Chargers WR Tre’ Harris (hip) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2ea7-d8cf-affb-beaf7b140000</link>
      <description>Harris popped up on the injury report with a hip issue, though he still practiced in a limited capacity. The rookie has been used sparingly this season, but did bring in three passes for 49 yards with Quentin Johnston out in Week 15. Harris and Johnston (groin) are both limited Wednesday while WR/KR Derius Davis (ankle) did not practice. The Chargers’ wide receiver depth is mildly banged-up heading into Week 16 against the Cowboys.</description>

      <title>USC WR Makai Lemon has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2eb2-d1bc-a3fb-afb697c40000</link>
      <description>Lemon enters draft season as one of the country’s top wide receiver prospects. He finished junior year at USC with 79 receptions for 1,156 yards and 11 touchdowns, winning the Fred Biletnikoff Award for nation’s most outstanding receiver. The 21-year-old announced his intention to declare for the 2026 NFL Draft on social media, foregoing his remaining year of eligibility. Lemon has a chance to be the first USC wide receiver since Jordan Addison in 2023 to be selected in the first round.</description>

      <title>Saints signed RB Nyheim Hines to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2ec5-d77b-adfb-eec7166d0000</link>
      <description>The Saints backfield is currently dealing with multiple injuries as neither Alvin Kamara (knee) or Devin Neal (ankle) practiced on Wednesday. As a result, the team has added Hines as depth on the practice squad behind Audric Estime and Evan Hull on the active roster. Neal is already ruled out for Sunday and Kamara is currently on the wrong side of questionable, so it is possible we see Hines on the field sooner rather than later.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Seahawks LT Charles Cross (hamstring) has a “2-4 week injury.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2efa-d1bc-a3fb-affe458e0000</link>
      <description>Cross has already been ruled out for Thursday’s Week 16 game against the Rams and is going to be out for longer, according to Rapoport. The Seahawks’ left tackle is expected to miss at least two weeks, but should return for Seattle’s playoff run. Backup Josh Jones will take over for Sam Darnold’s blindside in the meantime.</description>

      <title>Steelers signed EDGE Jeremiah Moon off the Panthers’ practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-31b2-d005-a9bf-f9b6de290000</link>
      <description>Moon played for the Steelers last year but didn’t make the roster for this season. The Panthers scooped him up and he has appeared in one game for them, playing exclusively on special teams. Moon will give the Steelers some extra depth after they lost T.J. Watt to a lung issue.</description>

      <title>Josina Anderson reports Bill Belichick has “upper-level personnel still fond of him in Atlanta, New York, and Cleveland.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3218-d005-a9bf-fa3cd03d0000</link>
      <description>That is presumably the New York Giants. She added, “There’s been recent interest expressed, at the very least, in speaking with Bill Belichick on an exploratory basis from two teams.” That is a lot of qualifiers tied to the supposed interest, but it does make sense. Every team without a head coach or considering moving on from their boss will be doing their due diligence over the next few months. Belichick is in the conversation for the greatest coach of all time. It would be irresponsible not to give him a call if you’re looking for a new boss. On the other hand, the game appeared to pass him by at the end of his time in New England. He then went to the college ranks, where controversy and failure followed close behind. North Carolina went 4-8 under his leadership in 2025. It wouldn’t be surprising for Belichick and UNC to agree that he is best fit for an NFL gig. Whether or not someone gives him the opportunity in the offseason remains to be seen.</description>

      <title>Colts designated Anthony Richardson (eye) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3254-d8cf-affb-be7e2d470000</link>
      <description>The Colts now have three weeks to officially activate Richardson from injured reserve. Head coach Shane Steichen said he still has some vision limitations. As Rapoport notes, this is largely just to get him back on the practice field. The Colts are rolling with Philip Rivers for now and have Riley Leonard as a backup option in the meantime. Richardson is undoubtedly still at least a few weeks away from returning, if not more. Unless Rivers struggles mightily, Richardson will be relegated to backup duties once fully cleared.</description>
