      <title>Jaguars activated TE Brenton Strange (hip) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ad65-db57-afda-ff77e9e40000</link>
      <description>Strange last played in Week 5 and missed the previous five games for a Jaguars team struggling through a multitude of injuries. His return comes in the wake of the signing of Jakobi Meyers as the trade deadline, meaning he is unlikely to return to the same robust receiving role he left when injured.</description>

      <title>Panthers removed WR Xavier Legette from the injury report Saturday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ad6a-d82c-a79a-bffec8cd0000</link>
      <description>That places Legette in line to play on Monday Night Football against the 49ers. Legette managed just 55% of the offensive snaps while dealing with a hip injury in Week 11 but could return to a more robust role against the injury-riddled San Francisco defense. Fantasy managers in a bind due to bye weeks can comfortably start the second-year receiver as a viable FLEX option.</description>

      <title>Seahawks placed WR Tory Horton (shin) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ad6f-d90e-a9da-bf6f7d010000</link>
      <description>Horton had already been ruled out for Week 12 after also missing Week 10 and Week 11, mean he will miss a minimum of six games while dealing with a shin injury that popped up before the team’s Week 10 contest. His absence means far less than it otherwise would had the team not traded for veteran Rashid Shaheed at the deadline, something that now looks more substantial considering Horton’s placement on injured reserve.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Packers “plan to work out RB Josh Jacobs” before determining his status for Week 12 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b0d2-d90e-a9da-bfdf57850000</link>
      <description>Jacobs is dealing with a knee contusion but is pushing to play in Week 12. He was initially expected to miss at least one week, but the veteran back returned to practice on Thursday and was listed as questionable at the end of the week. He is a true game-time call versus Minnesota. That game takes place in the early window, meaning fantasy managers will know Jacobs’ status before all of Sunday’s games kick off. Emanuel Wilson will draw the start if Jacobs is ruled out.</description>

      <title>Saints waived WR Brandin Cooks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b0d7-db57-afda-f6f7eb280000</link>
      <description>For real this time. Cooks was reportedly waived earlier in the week, but contract issues stalled the move. The Saints were cutting the veteran wideout to allow him to sign with a contender of his choosing. They restructured his contract before cutting him to make it more unappealing, ensuring no one would claim him on waivers. That is explicitly prohibited by the NFL. This issue has since been resolved and Cooks is now able to be claimed by teams.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Kenneth Walker (glue) is expected to play in Week 12 against the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b0dd-d82c-a79a-b3dd99160000</link>
      <description>No surprises here as head coach Mike Macdonald said as much on Friday. Walker was a surprise addition to the injury report. He did not practice on Friday and was listed as questionable, but Macdonald quickly called the absence precautionary and assured us fantasy managers that Walker would be out there on Sunday. Even if his workload is slightly reduced because of the injury, Walker is still in the RB2 ranks for a great matchup against the Titans.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Alvin Kamara (ankle) is expected to play in Week 12 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b0e0-d413-ad9f-b5fdc6e70000</link>
      <description>Kamara has been playing through the ankle injury for most of the 2025 season. He hasn’t missed time because of it yet and was limited in practice throughout the week. Kamara never appeared to be at any risk of missing Week 12 despite the questionable tag. As a slight favorite of the Falcons this week, the Saints might actually get the chance to establish their ground game. Kamara hasn’t been efficient between the tackles this year, but a solid workload will keep him in the RB3 ranks for Week 12.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Bucky Irving (toe/shoulder) is expected to play in Week 13 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b0e5-d90e-a9da-bfef049c0000</link>
      <description>Per Schefter, Irving looked strong in practice and “might have been able to play” in Week 12 versus the Rams, but the Bucs decided to give him one more week of rest. Sean Tucker and Rachaad White will hold down the backfield for one more week. Tucker took over the backfield last week, seeing 19 carries to White’s 10. Tucker ran for 106 yards and two scores. He also found the end zone once through the air. Tucker will push for an RB2 rank this week while White is nothing more than a low-end RB3 in PPR formats.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Xavier Worthy (aknle) is expected to play in Week 12 against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b0f0-d413-ad9f-b5fdc81c0000</link>
      <description>Worthy was held out of Wednesday’s practice but steadily made progress throughout the week. He was listed as a full participant on Friday before being given a questionable tag. Worthy has fallen by the wayside with Rashee Rice back. He has topped 40 yards one time since Week 7, Rice’s first game of the year. Worthy hasn’t scored with Rice active. He is stuck in the WR4 ranks for Week 12.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Aron Rodgers (wrist) “has been pushing to play Sunday vs. the Bears.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b0fa-d82c-a79a-b3fedd870000</link>
      <description>Rodgers is dealing with a fracture in his left wrist. As Schefter notes, Pittsburgh’s doctors have been more cautious in regards to the injury. Rodgers suffered the injury in Week 11 versus the Bengals. He managed a light week of practice before being listed as questionable for today’s game. Per Schefter, “If the decision is left to Rodgers, he will play.” Mason Rudolph will draw the start if Rodgers is ruled out.</description>
