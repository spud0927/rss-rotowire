      <title>Seahawks RB Zach Charbonnet (knee) left Seattle’s Divisional Round game against the 49ers and is questionable to return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cefd-d56e-afff-eefdf7230000</link>
      <description>He was tackled awkwardly on a third-and-1 carry, spent some time in the medical tent after walking off gingerly with trainers, and was later spotted walking to the locker room. Charbonnet had five carries for 20 yards before leaving. Kenneth Walker seems likely to carry the bulk of the load with Charbonnet out, though George Holani could get extra work here seeing as how as of this typing it’s 24-6 Seahawks.</description>

      <title>Falcons hired Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf01-d968-a19b-dff1fca30000</link>
      <description>Stefanski gets a five-year contract from the Falcons. This has seemed to be a fait accompli since John Harbaugh agreed to a deal with the Giants. Stefanski was reportedly the favorite in Atlanta on Friday per SNY’s Connor Hughes, and after Stefanski got the second interview docket finalized, the Falcons just decided to go ahead and make that irrelevant. Atlanta gets the best available offensive mind on the market, and Bijan Robinson should only continue to flourish under Stefanski’s guidance. His biggest task will be, as it was in Cleveland, getting the most out of what looks to be a substandard quarterback room. Michael Penix (knee) is under contract, but perhaps not a certainty to be ready for the season. The Falcons could cut Kirk Cousins to free up salary space, but don’t necessarily have to if Stefanski would turn to him as a starter. Atlanta’s quarterback decision will set up some offseason dominoes. But for now, they have to be thrilled to land a two-time AP Coach of the Year — even if he is coming off two rough seasons in Cleveland.</description>

      <title>Courtland Sutton caught 4-of-9 targets for 53 yards in the Broncos’ AFC Divisional Round win over the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf0d-d56e-afff-efed68830000</link>
      <description>Sutton was matched up against the Bills’ top cornerback, Christian Benford, for much of the day and was held in check for most of it. He did make a few key catches near the end of the fourth quarter and could shoulder a heavy burden next week with both Pat Bryant (concussion) and Troy Franklin (hamstring) banged up. However, with Jarett Stidham at quarterback, it’s hard to get overly excited about Sutton next week.</description>

      <title>Lil’Jordan Humphrey caught 2-of-5 targets for 31 yards and a touchdown in the Broncos’ AFC Divisional Round win over the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf14-d56e-afff-effc5ee00000</link>
      <description>Humphrey was thrust into a larger role after Pat Bryant suffered a concussion on the first drive. However, things didn’t start great for Humphrey as he dropped a sure-fire touchdown pass from Bo Nix on that same drive. Later, right before halftime, Humphrey was able to get behind fourth-string safety Darnell Savage for a touchdown. The 27-year-old may be relied on again next week if Bryant can’t return to the field.</description>

      <title>Evan Engram caught 1-of-3 targets for seven yards in the Broncos’ Divisional Round win over the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf17-d35e-a1bf-cfd76e710000</link>
      <description>You’d be forgiven if you didn’t notice that Engram played in this game. The Bills are generally pretty strong against tight ends, but the Broncos didn’t seem too interested in getting Engram involved in this one. There’s a chance that changes next week with backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham under center.</description>

      <title>Keon Coleman caught 1-of-3 targets for 10 yards and a touchdown in the Bills’ AFC Divisional Round loss to the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf19-d968-a19b-dff9be0b0000</link>
      <description>The touchdown catch was a nice play where Coleman caught a quick slant, planted his foot, avoided a defender, and then dove to stretch the ball across the end zone. The 22-year-old had a brutal drop in the end zone earlier in the game on a ball that hit him right in the hands. It wouldn’t have been a touchdown anyway due to a holding penalty, but the drop is indicative of the struggles Coleman has had in his second season. The former second-round pick caught 38 of 59 targets during the regular season for 404 yards and four touchdowns. He only played in 13 games and was a healthy inactive in a few, as Coleman dealt with some off-field disciplinary issues. It wouldn’t be out of the question for the Bills to see if another team wanted to take a gamble on Coleman, but his value may be too low for a trade right now.</description>

      <title>Mecole Hardman caught 1-of-2 targets for four yards and a touchdown in the Bills’ AFC Divisional Round loss to the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf1f-d968-a19b-dfffde170000</link>
      <description>Hardman was elevated from the practice squad with both Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers suffering season-ending ACL injuries. His touchdown was the first score of the game for the Bills, but he also dropped a catch that would have kept Buffalo’s drive alive at the end of the fourth quarter. Hardman had no catches on just one target during the regular season as he bounced around a few practice squads. He’ll probably need to settle for a practice squad spot in 2026 as well.</description>

      <title>Curtis Samuel caught 1-of-3 targets for two yards in the Bills’ AFC Divisional Round loss to the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf24-dc7a-af9b-cfbfaa7e0000</link>
      <description>Samuel was activated off the IR in time for this game, with Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers suffering season-ending ACL injuries. As has become the trend, Samuel was not heavily involved in this game and ended the regular season with seven catches on nine targets for 81 yards and a touchdown. It ends another disappointing season for Samuel, who signed a three-year, $24 million contract two years ago. He has one more year on that contract, but the Bills could release him this offseason and take on $3.4 million in dead cap. That seems to be the likely endpoint of this marriage.</description>

      <title>Seahawks LT Charles Cross (foot) left Seattle’s Divisional Round game against the 49ers and is questionable to return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf28-dc7a-af9b-cfbf35a60000</link>
      <description>He spent time in the blue medical tent and immediately went to the locker room in the third quarter. Amari Kight replaced Cross. Cross missed time down the stretch with hamstring and knee injuries, so while this is a new designation, they have gotten used to playing without him in a playoff atmosphere. This will be something to watch ahead of the NFC Championship game assuming we haven’t jinxed the Seahawks to one of the most unbelievable blown leads of all-time by typing this.</description>

      <title>Sam Darnold completed 12-of-17 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown in the Seahawks’, 41-6, Divisional Round win over the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-cf4f-dc7a-af9b-cfff62960000</link>
      <description>His first throw looked a little off, but Darnold didn’t seem to be any worse for the wear after popping up with an oblique injury on Thursday. Drifting to his left, he found Jaxon Smith-Njigba on a dotted throw to the end zone back pylon for his only touchdown. Seattle did not need to do much on offense after an early touchdown on a kick return and a fumble by Jake Tonges staked them to a 17-0 first quarter lead, so we never got to see what Darnold’s total form was. He’ll host the winner of the Rams/Bears game on Sunday in the NFC Championship game.</description>
