      <title>Vikings ruled out C Ryan Kelly (concussion) for Week 5 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aa30-d95b-addb-ea7652f10000</link>
      <description>In addition to Kelly, backup center Michael Jurgens (hamstring) has also been ruled out. The Vikings will also be out RT Brian O’Neill (knee) and LG Donovan Jackson (wrist), leaving the offensive line particularly thin against a physical Browns defensive front that’s led by Myles Garrett. With a Week 6 bye on the horizon, the Vikings will hope a week away will give their team plenty of time to heal up once they return stateside.</description>

      <title>Vikings ruled out Andrew Van Ginkel (neck) for Week 5 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aa35-deb6-a7fd-fbff3c4d0000</link>
      <description>Van Ginkel suffered his neck injury in Week 2 and hasn’t been heard from since. The veteran linebacker has yet to return to the practice field, but will have a Week 6 bye before setting his sights on Week 7 against the Eagles. The Vikings’ decision not to place him on injured reserve suggests they believe he could return after the bye, but the proof will be in his practice status ahead of Week 7.</description>

      <title>49ers DT Kalia Davis will undergo surgery to repair a broken hand.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aa3a-dca3-a9fb-bfbb8b940000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport was first to report the surgery. According to Rap, Davis “could miss as few as two games,” and the fourth-year lineman is expected to return to play with a club on his hand. Davis has totaled seven tackles and two TFLs in five starts for the 49ers this season, and is quietly stepping into a key role for Kyle Shanahan’s defense after spending the previous two seasons as a backup.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Buccaneers RB Bucky Irving (foot) is expected to miss Week 5 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aa40-d6e9-af9d-aad077970000</link>
      <description>Things have been trending in this direction ever since Irving first went down. He was spotted in a walking boot and using crutches on Wednesday and was a DNP on both Wednesday and Thursday. The reports are that Irving’s injury isn’t believed to be long-term, but the Buccaneers’ RB1 will miss at least one game. With Irving sidelined, the Buccaneers will likely utilize a backfield split with Rachaad White and Sean Tucker, with White as the preferred option on passing downs. He should have some nice value in PPR leagues after thriving as one of the top PPR scams in fantasy since entering the league in 2022.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Joseph Person reports Chuba Hubbard (calf) is not expected to land on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aa69-d6e9-af9d-aaf957d50000</link>
      <description>Person reports that Hubbard “will miss Sunday’s home game against the Dolphins, according to a league source,” although we are still waiting for the team to confirm as much when they release their final injury report before the weekend. According to Person, the calf injury Hubbard is dealing with is a similar one that cost him two games at the end of last season. We’ll see if he’s able to practice ahead of Week 6’s game against the Cowboys, but for now, it will be Rico Dowdle leading the Panthers’ backfield into Week 5 against the Fins.</description>

      <title>Eagles LB Nakobe Dean (knee) will not be activated for Week 5 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aa79-d6e9-af9d-aaf933260000</link>
      <description>Dean, who began practicing earlier this week, took to his Instagram to share that he will miss Sunday’s game against the Broncos. The fourth-year vet is still working his way back from a torn patellar tendon he suffered last postseason, but is nearing a return after the team opened his practice window earlier in the week. With the Eagles set to play on Thursday night in Week 6, it wouldn’t be surprising if the team also opted to hold him out of the short week before giving him a chance to return in Week 7. Things remain up in the air at this time, but with only 21 days to activate him after designating him for a return, the Eagles will have Dean back in short order.</description>

      <title>Jets HC Aaron Glenn said Braelon Allen (knee) will miss 8-12 weeks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aa7e-d95b-addb-ea7ece270000</link>
      <description>An eight-week absence would put Allen on course for a return around Week 12 or 13. A 12-week absence would put Allen more in the Week 15 or 16 range. Regardless, it’s the long-term absence many feared after the team went and placed Allen on injured reserve earlier in the week, and also floated around the possibility of surgery for the second-year back. Glenn reiterated on Friday that the option of surgery remains on the table. The Jets already signed Khaili Herbert as added depth for their backfield, but Isaiah Davis will get the first crack at backing up Breece Hall, and is worth a stash wherever still available.</description>

      <title>Jets HC Aaron Glenn said Michael Carter (concussion) will miss Week 5 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aab5-d95b-addb-eaf772e70000</link>
      <description>Backup nickel Isaiah Oliver will presumably take over in Carter’s absence. Carter, who was a DNP all week, was unable to clear concussion protocol in time for Sunday’s Week 5 matchup and will now eye a Week 6 game against the Broncos for his targeted return date. While Carter is sidelined this weekend, Glenn said RB/KR Kene Nwangwu (hamstring) could be a game-time decision.</description>

      <title>Jets HC Aaron Glenn said Jermaine Johnson (calf) could be a game-time decision for Week 5 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aab9-dca3-a9fb-bfb92a020000</link>
      <description>Johnson hasn’t played since Week 2 and was listed as a DNP on both Wednesday and Thursday, so he’s likely on the wrong side of playing this week. The fourth-year pass rusher has totaled seven tackles this season and is still waiting to secure his first sack of 2025.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aab9-dca3-a9fb-bfb92a020000</guid>

      <title>Browns HC Kevin Stefanski said he is “hopeful” that Jack Conklin (elbow) will play in Week 5 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-aac8-dca3-a9fb-bfd9306e0000</link>
      <description>Conklin was upgraded to a full participant in Friday’s practice, suggesting he’ll have a good chance to play despite his questionable tag. The veteran tackle hasn’t played since Week 1 and, if active, will be tasked with protecting the blindside of lefty QB Dillon Gabriel, who is slated to make his first career start against the Vikings in London.</description>
