      <title>ESPN’s Kevin Seifert reports the Vikings confirmed Rondale Moore (knee) will be placed on injured reserve and miss the 2025 season.</title>

      <description>Moore will miss a second consecutive season due to preseason injury, which opens up the bottom of the Vikings wideout depth chart. The Vikings haven’t seem overly impressed with rookie Tai Felton on offense, which means they may need to go out and get a stopgap receiver during Jordan Addison’s early-season suspension. Moore will turn 26 next June, so his career is far from over unless he wants it to be, but he’ll likely be seeking another prove-it contract in 2026.</description>

      <title>Kenneth Walker (undisclosed) is back at practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9ffe-d45c-a7fc-9ffe249f0000</link>
      <description>It seems like if Walker’s foot (what he missed time with earlier in camp) is an issue, it’s one that will be long-term managed by the Seahawks. It’s probably not worth making a big deal out of at this point. Seahawks HC Mike Macdonald said “We have a plan for Ken, and we’re sticking to the plan,” when asked about Walker yesterday.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Brooks Kubena believes there’s a “growing sense” that Jahan Dotson “could contribute more” than he did in 2024.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a024-d90d-a5bd-a27f8dc40000</link>
      <description>Well, it would be hard to contribute less than 19 catches for 216 yards over a full season, folks! Kubena believes Dotson’s advancement is “notable” and that the ball skills that made him a 2022 first-round pick are “showing up more” in his first full training camp in Philadelphia. We’re not expecting the Eagles to be invested in feeding Dotson after declining his fifth-year option, but it certainly would make sense for him to do better than he did in 2024.</description>

      <title>Chargers OC Greg Roman said Omarion Hampton will rotate with another back in Week 1 even if Najee Harris (eye) isn’t ready to go.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a03d-df63-a199-f93fbd510000</link>
      <description>Who said back is, Roman says, is “wide open.” We’d guess the Chargers would probably go to Hassan Haskins as a between-the-tackles sledgehammer in that scenario. This isn’t exactly breaking news — every team rotates running backs — but it does look like we shouldn’t look at Hampton’s Week 1 assignment as a clear runway to 30 touches if Harris is out.</description>

      <title>Chargers OL Mekhi Becton is “working through something” after missing the last two weeks of practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a082-df63-a199-f9ab27290000</link>
      <description>Offensive coordinator Greg Roman said Becton will be fine and is “getting a lot of great meeting time, walkthrough time.” The 26-year-old signed a two-year, $20 million deal with the Chargers in the offseason and has a chance to start as a blocker for the run game. Roman said he is “not putting anything in concrete”, but Becton should be back to start the season.</description>

      <title>Texans RBs Nick Chubb (head) and Dameon Pierce (quad) split first-team snaps Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a08b-df63-a199-f9ab40500000</link>
      <description>Chubb returned to practice after a head injury and split first-team snaps with Pierce, who was a full-go in practice for the first time since he strained his quadriceps. With Joe Mixon still sidelined with ankle and foot issues, the Texans have a murky backfield split between the veterans. Chubb is a downhill runner who has lost some burst while Pierce was strictly a backup and special teamer last season. Splitting first-team snaps indicates this backfield will be a committee when Mixon is out, with rookie Woody Marks mixing in for pass-catching.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Kris Rhim reports Chargers RB Najee Harris (eye) participated in football drills Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a0af-d90d-a5bd-a2ffd4f30000</link>
      <description>It was Harris’ first time participating in football drills this training camp. Rhim reports the 27-year-old did drills with a football off to the side with an athletic trainer. He is slowly progressing back to full football activities between jogging and individual drills on Tuesday, but remains on the PUP list for now. Omarion Hampton is the Chargers’ starter, while the third-string spot still remains open for competition. Harris may not be ready for Week 1, but working with a football is an optimistic sign that he is on his way back.</description>

      <title>Bills signed James Cook to a four-year, $48 million contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a337-d05a-adda-abb75f200000</link>
      <description>Head coach Sean McDermott hinted at the extension yesterday when Cook returned to practice, telling reporters, “Things have changed.” According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the deal includes $30 million guaranteed. It’s the same length and value as Josh Jacobs’ contract, putting the two backs at sixth in the yearly salary rankings among running backs. Unlike Jacobs, a large chunk of Cook’s deal is guaranteed. Cook broke out with 16 rushing touchdowns and over 1,000 yards on the ground last year, though he ran for fewer yards and was less involved as a pass-catcher compared to his previous season. Cook sits on the RB1/2 border heading into his fourth year, with touchdown regression likely preventing him from pushing any higher in the ranks.</description>

      <title>NewOrleans.Football’s Nick Underhill reports Saints LG Trevor Penning suffered a turf toe injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a35e-d45c-a7fc-a35e273d0000</link>
      <description>Underhill didn’t put a timeline on Penning’s injury but did note that players typically need 4-6 weeks to recover from this type of issue. That would make Penning unlikely to suit up for Week 1, though it’s possible his timeline is shorter. Penning is making the transition from tackle to guard this year, and early reports from training camp were positive. The lost practice reps may be even more detrimental to Penning than a missed game.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jesse Newell believes the Chiefs “envision a role” for WR Tyquan Thornton this season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a389-df63-a199-fbab24010000</link>
      <description>This isn’t the first we’re hearing of a role for the former second-round pick either. ESPN’s Nate Taylor wrote about a potential rotational gig for Thornton last week. Newell calls him a perfect fit for the field-stretching role held by Justin Watson in previous seasons. Thornton was cut by the Patriots in the middle of the 2024 season and the Chiefs quickly scooped him up on their practice squad. A strong start to training camp has him as a heavy favorite to make the team’s 53-man roster. Though he is still a long-shot to be fantasy-relevant this year, Thornton seems to have found his niche in the pros.</description>
