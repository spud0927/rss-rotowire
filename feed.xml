      <title>Jaguars traded T Fred Johnson to the Eagles in exchange for for a 2026 seventh-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de5b-d332-a1fd-de7ff04b0000</link>
      <description>Johnson returns to the Eagles after signing with the Jaguars in March. The 28-year-old will likely be a backup bookend for Philadelphia; a role that he served for the majority of the 2024 season with the club.</description>

      <title>Bills released RB Jarveon Howard.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de66-db7b-a5dd-fe6607700000</link>
      <description>Howard’s release comes with the designation of “failure to disclose condition,” which isn’t a common one. The 25-year-old could be a candidate for a practice squad, but it seems likely it won’t be with Buffalo.</description>

      <title>Packers acquired T Darian Kinnard from the Eagles in exchange for a 2027 sixth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de99-dbe3-a9bb-fedb6e7d0000</link>
      <description>It’s the third trade of the day for the Eagles, and the second involving a tackle. After re-acquiring Fred Johnson from the Jaguars, Kinnard become expendable, and instead he’ll serve in a similar capacity for Green Day.</description>

      <title>Courtland Sutton said he believes Marvin Mims is the Broncos’ No. 2 wide receiver.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-deb0-de13-afdc-defb241d0000</link>
      <description>Stuck in a part-time offensive role through two NFL seasons, Mims has teased excellent per-play efficiency, particularly as a post-catch producer. Sutton aptly notes that Mims “can make plays anywhere,” and his special teams returner showings have bagged him second- and first-team All-Pro honors. If Mims has indeed secured the No. 2 wide receiver role and will be allowed to remain on the field in two-wide receiver sets, we could see a breakout season from him in 2025. His PPR WR55, 13th-round ADP makes him a low-risk, high-reward draft pick.</description>

      <title>The San Francisco Standard’s Tim Kawakami reports, Jauan Jennings’ “lingering calf injury and long contractual stalemate with the 49ers could combine to send him to the injured reserve list this week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-dece-de13-afdc-decf483b0000</link>
      <description>Kawakami outlines multiple scenarios that could take place between now and Week 1, with frustration growing on both the 49ers’ and Jennings’ sides. Jennings is reportedly set to make $1.5 million guaranteed, and up to $3.5 million in performance incentives this year. Kawakami suggests the idea of an IR stint “could be a tacit threat to the Jennings camp.” Should they opt to make the move, it could also serve as “a nervous compromise and delay tactic for this increasingly tense situation.” This scenario is bad for all involved, though, as it limits their ability to bring back other players who are also injured. It’s entirely “possible nothing dramatic happens this week,” Jennings shows up for Week 1 with a healthy calf and all of this fades into the background. Still, the tense situation in San Francisco is worth noting. Regardless, for fantasy leagues with an injured reserve spot, Jennings looks like a sharp pick at his PPR WR46 ADP.</description>

      <title>Texans Insider Aaron Wilson reports RB Joe Mixon has had a “tough and complicated rehab.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e183-d332-a1fd-f7b7c2aa0000</link>
      <description>Speaking in a video on YouTube, Texans Insider Aaron Wilson said running back Joe Mixon had “multiple injections and electromagnetic therapy to remove scar tissue” in the early stages of a “tough and complicated rehab.” Wilson adds that Mixon’s recovery started off well before “sort of hitting a plateau,” before Mixon sought alternative treatment. Wilson ends by saying, “I just don’t think he’s ready. My hunch is that it may take more time.” It certainly sounds like those closest to the organization are not expecting Mixon on the field to start the season, backing up previous reports that he is a candidate for the PUP list to start the season. Nick Chubb was held out of Saturday’s preseason game and is likely the Week 1 favorite for early-down carries in Houston.</description>

      <title>Dolphins released CB Mike Hilton.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e1a4-db7b-a5dd-e1a4eda60000</link>
      <description>Hilton joined the Dolphins in late July but ultimately came up short of making the final 53. He played his previous four seasons with the Bengals, starting 23 games during the 2023 and 2024 seasons. The veteran has ample experience on both the perimeter and at nickel. It’s possible the Dolphins are engaging in roster shenanigans and will re-sign Hilton after final cuts, but Hilton should catch on somewhere.</description>

      <title>Colts released LB Solomon DeShields.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e1d4-d332-a1fd-f7f66c200000</link>
      <description>DeShields went undrafted after spending four years at Pittsburgh and one year with Texas A&amp;M. The Colts brought him in for training camp, but he didn’t do enough to crack the opening 53-man roster. We’ll see if DeShields catches on with another team or if the Colts try to bring him back on the practice squad.</description>

      <title>Allen Lazard will practice Monday and is on track to play in Week 1 against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e1dd-dbe3-a9bb-f1df43c90000</link>
      <description>Lazard has been dealing with a shoulder injury for a few weeks, but is back at practice and on track to be available for Week 1’s game against the Steelers. Lazard lost the WR2 competition to Josh Reynolds in camp and isn’t fantasy-relevant at the moment.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e1dd-dbe3-a9bb-f1df43c90000</guid>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports WR Terry McLaurin has agreed to a three-year extension worth over $96M with the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e1e1-d332-a1fd-f7f712cf0000</link>
      <description>That wasn’t so hard, was it? McLaurin has essentially missed all of the offseason with a hold-in as he was in pursuit of a new contract. Now the receiver who turns 30 years old next month will be back on the field with a new contract when the Commanders take on the Giants in Week 1. McLaurin’s average salary is now $32 million, which is the same as A.J. Brown and less than only Ja’Marr Chase, Justin Jefferson, Ceedee Lamb, D.K. Metcalf and Garrett Wilson among receivers.</description>
