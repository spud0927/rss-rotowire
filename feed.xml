      <title>Drake London (illness/back) is active for Week 11 against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d83-d673-a39e-ad93f2bb0000</link>
      <description>This was always the expectation, despite London being listed as questionable. Per usual, London is in line for WR1 numbers this week. Inactive for the Falcons are CB Dee Alford, CB Mike Hughes, ILB Josh Woods, EDGE Leonard Floyd, G Matthew Bergeron, DL Elijah Garcia, and DL Zach Harrison.</description>

      <title>Bills made Keon Coleman a healthy inactive for Week 11 against the Bucs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8ca3-d713-ad9e-ecf7a8910000</link>
      <description>The Bills needed to shake things up after an embarrassing loss to the Dolphins last week, and they’re doing so in a big way with their receiver room. Josh Palmer is back after being out with a groin injury since Week 6, and he figures to take over much of Keon Coleman’s work which makes him a worthwhile stash in fantasy leagues. Mecole Hardman was also signed to the active roster on Saturday night and will likely serve primarily as a return man. The Bills also elevated Gabe Davis from the practice squad, so he will return to the Bills lineup after missing the start of the year while recovering from ACL surgery. The Bills other inactives are WR Elijah Moore, LB Shaq Thompson, CB Ja’Marcus Ingram, DT Phidarian Mathis, OL Chase Lundt and TE Dalton Kincaid.</description>

      <title>Giants CB Paulson Adebo (knee) is active for New York’s Week 11 game against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d85-d45b-affe-dd97c17d0000</link>
      <description>Adebo has not played since Week 7, so the Giants will have their big offseason CB addition back in the fold to try to contain Jordan Love on the rare occasions when Matt LaFleur actually unleashes him. Bobby Okereke (shoulder) is also playing off a questionable tag. Inactive for the Giants are: OLB Kayvon Thibodeaux (shoulder), QB Jaxson Dart (concussion), WR Darius Slayton (hamstring), S Tyler Nubin (neck), DL Chauncey Golston (neck), DL Rakeem Nuñez-Roches (toe) and lone healthy scratch OT James Hudson III.</description>

      <title>Steelers OG Isaac Seumalo (pectoral) is active for Week 11 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d83-d1e7-a1fa-dfeba3c00000</link>
      <description>Seumalo logged two limited practices to start the week and was downgraded to a DNP on Friday. It’s possible that DNP was more of a rest day, but whatever the case, the veteran guard will be good to go against the Bengals. While Seumalo is active, the Steelers did rule out QB Will Howard, CB Darius Slay, LB Cole Holcomb, LB Alex Highsmith, OG Andrus Peat, DT Brodric Martin-Rhodes, and DT Logan Lee for Week 11.</description>

      <title>Panthers declared WR Hunter Renfrow, S Lathan Ransom, LB Trevin Wallace, C Nick Samac, DT Jared Harrison-Hunte, TE James Mitchell, and DT Cam Jackson inactive for Week 11 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d86-d1e7-a1fa-dfee70840000</link>
      <description>No surprises here as the Panthers didn’t have anyone listed as questionable heading into the weekend. Renfrow hasn’t played since Week 6. He remains a healthy scratch.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d86-d1e7-a1fa-dfee70840000</guid>

      <title>Packers K Brandon McManus is inactive for Week 11 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d88-d45b-affe-dd9eae6b0000</link>
      <description>34-year-old McManus is missing too much time with injury for a kicker this season. Lucas Havrisik will handle kicking duties today in New York. He’s a mediocre fantasy option with the Pack’s offense really going through it right now.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d88-d45b-affe-dd9eae6b0000</guid>

      <title>Texans activated TE Cade Stover (foot) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d75-d45b-affe-ddf7d51e0000</link>
      <description>He was questionable but will return from injured reserve today. It’s possible he eats into Dalton Schultz’s snap share a bit. Inactive for the Texans are: DB Jalen Pitre (concussion), QB C.J. Stroud (concussion), K Ka’imi Fairbairn (quad), G Ed Ingram (knee), WR Braxton Berrios, RB Dameon Pierce, and OT Jarrett Kingston.</description>

      <title>Bucs declared OLB Haason Reddick, RB Bucky Irving, WR Chris Godwin Jr., DL C.J. Brewer. OLB Markees Watts, OL Ben Bredeson, and OL Elijah Klein inactive for Week 11 against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d88-d1e7-a1fa-dfeafacb0000</link>
      <description>Irving, Godwin, and Reddick were all ruled out earlier in the week. That’s five starters in total who the Bucks will have inactive for Sunday’s game. Sean Tucker will carry much of the load against st a vulnerable Bills run defense and the rest of the Bucs pass rushers will need to step up to try and get to Josh Allen.</description>

      <title>Aaron Jones (soulder/toe) is active for Week 11 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d8b-d673-a39e-ad9b4d430000</link>
      <description>Jones was limited in practice to start the week but got in a full practice session on Friday and will play against Chicago’s exploitable run defense. Jones, after taking over the backfield over the past two weeks, should be considered a top-20 fantasy play against the Bears. Jordan Mason is little more than a contingency option for now. Vikings declared OLB Chaz Chambliss, OLB Jonathan Greenard, T Walter Rouse, TE Ben Sims, and DL Elijah Williams inactive against Chicago.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d8b-d673-a39e-ad9b4d430000</guid>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Bills WR Keon Coleman missed a team meeting on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8d93-d1e7-a1fa-dffb56330000</link>
      <description>The team disciplined Coleman by making him a healthy inactive for Week 11 against the Bucs. The Bills reportedly planned on playing Coleman in his usual role this week before he missed the Friday meeting. Coleman has 32 receptions on 49 targets this season for 330 yards and three touchdowns. His absence will likely open up more routes and targets for Josh Palmer, who becomes a desperation fantasy option in deeper formats with Coleman being inactive against Tampa.</description>
