      <title>Bills coach Sean McDermott said RT Spencer Brown (shoulder) could go on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a862-d90e-a9da-bf6f19d50000</link>
      <description>Brown left Week 12’s loss to the Texans twice and came back with a sling towards the end of the fourth quarter. While doctors are still evaluating him, it doesn’t sound like good news. Ryan Van Demark came on for Brown towards the end of the game and would likely be his replacement going forward.</description>

      <title>Bills coach Sean McDermott said LB Terrel Bernard (shoulder) could possibly land on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a865-db57-afda-fe7794360000</link>
      <description>Bernard was spotted on the sideline in a sling during the game after his injury. We’d be surprised if he was able to go in Week 13, but it’s still theoretically possible he avoids IR.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers WR Sterling Shepard (shoulder) is not on Tampa Bay’s final Week 12 injury report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a867-d413-ad9f-bdffbf020000</link>
      <description>He got in full sessions on both Thursday and Friday. Shepard would retain some low-end PPR scam juice if Chris Godwin remains sidelined this weekend.</description>

      <title>Bills head coach Sean McDermott said CB Maxwell Hairston is in the NFL’s concussion protocol.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a863-d90e-a9da-bf6fc93d0000</link>
      <description>Hairston suffered a concussion in the Bills’ Week 12 loss to the Texans on Thursday Night Football. The rookie cornerback has forced one incompletion and notched two interceptions since taking the field in Week 8, following a training camp knee injury.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers QB Baker Mayfield (illness) is not on Tampa Bay’s final Week 12 injury report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a869-db57-afda-fe7b7c290000</link>
      <description>Neither is Emeka Egbuka. Whatever was going around in Tampa Bay earlier this week has dissipated, as all six players listed with illness recovered and are not on the final injury report.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers WR Chris Godwin (fibula) is questionable for Week 12.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a86b-d90e-a9da-bf6f016a0000</link>
      <description>Todd Bowles said that Godwin is “trending toward playing” earlier today. He went limited-full-limited in his three practice sessions this week and seems to be on the optimistic side of questionable. Godwin will probably be more of a FLEX than a WR3 in Week 13 due to a tough opponent (Rams) and the re-injury risk, but he could be startable in the playoffs if everything breaks right.</description>

      <title>Raiders EDGE Maxx Crosby (knee) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 12 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a88b-d82c-a79a-bb9f16910000</link>
      <description>Crosby practiced fully on Friday, restoring faith in the Raiders D/ST unit. Browns rookie QB Shedeur Sanders will make his first career start and Crosby and Co. this weekend. Sanders notched a 20.0 percent pressure-to-sack rate on 21 dropbacks in Week 11.</description>

      <title>Broncos signed K Wil Lutz to a three-year extension through 2028.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a8ac-d413-ad9f-bdfd33cd0000</link>
      <description>Lutz earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors last week by converting 5-of-5 field goals in the Broncos’ Week 11 win over the Chiefs. Lutz has converted 17-of-20 field goals and 24-of-24 extra points this season. The deal keeps him with the Broncos through his age-34 season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jordan Raanan reports that Giants QB Jaxson Dart (concussion) did not suffer any setbacks this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a8b7-d90e-a9da-bfbff1590000</link>
      <description>Per Raanan, the decision to hold Dart out for another week “was made by the doctors to play it safe with the young quarterback.” Good for them. Bad for the fantasy managers who had hoped to start him this week. Aside from saying Dart is “feeling better,” Raanan has not yet reported whether Dart is still experiencing symptoms. That part remains unclear. Hopefully, he returns for the team’s Week 13 matchup with the Patriots. The Giants notably go on bye in Week 14.</description>
