      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-dde4-dbe3-a9bb-fdf7658a0000</link>
      <description>Avery signed with the Buccaneers just two days ago and racked up seven tackles in the team’s preseason Week 3 game against the Bills on Saturday. He spent the first two preseason games on the Patriots’ roster, totaling five tackles and one forced incompletion with them.</description>

      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ddef-de13-afdc-dfef5d460000</link>
      <description>Phillips worked out with the Bills today, and evidently, it went well. The 32-year-old previously played for the Bills in 2019 and from 2022-2023. He spent the 2024 season with the Cowboys. He can be expected to serve as a rotational player on the Bills’ interior defensive line.</description>

      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ddf6-de13-afdc-dfff586b0000</link>
      <description>Davis caught one pass for 14 yards after being added as an undrafted free agent by the Broncos. The 6-foot-4 wideout is likely to hang around on the practice squad. Denver also waived linebacker Andrew Farmer according to Tomasson.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports that the Patriots are “shopping” S Kyle Dugger.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de1f-de13-afdc-dedf3fb00000</link>
      <description>Rapoport’s report backs up what Jordan Schultz reported on August 20th. The Patriots’ new coaching staff is hoping to move on from Dugger. Earlier today, ESPN’s Mike Reissreportedthat it has been a “challenging year” for Dugger, who underwent offseason ankle surgery and has played “deep into preseason games” this month.</description>

      <title>Lions released CB Dicaprio Bootle.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de17-d332-a1fd-de37c7200000</link>
      <description>Bootle, 27, was signed in the middle of July, and didn’t stick around past the summer. The speedy corner will now be free to sign with another team, but is likely just roster-fodder at this point.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de17-d332-a1fd-de37c7200000</guid>

      <title>Broncos waived CB Micah Abraham.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de44-dbe3-a9bb-fe57c8830000</link>
      <description>Abraham suited up for two Broncos preseason games this year, allowing one catch for nine yards on two targets. He recorded zero tackles. The 2024 sixth-round pick will now look to make a final roster elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Jaguars traded T Fred Johnson to the Eagles in exchange for for a 2026 seventh-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de5b-d332-a1fd-de7ff04b0000</link>
      <description>Johnson returns to the Eagles after signing with the Jaguars in March. The 28-year-old will likely be a backup bookend for Philadelphia; a role that he served for the majority of the 2024 season with the club.</description>

      <title>Bills released RB Jarveon Howard.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de66-db7b-a5dd-fe6607700000</link>
      <description>Howard’s release comes with the designation of “failure to disclose condition,” which isn’t a common one. The 25-year-old could be a candidate for a practice squad, but it seems likely it won’t be with Buffalo.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de66-db7b-a5dd-fe6607700000</guid>

      <title>Eagles traded T Darian Kinnard to the Packers in exchange for a 2027 sixth-round draft selection.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de99-dbe3-a9bb-fedb6e7d0000</link>
      <description>It’s the third trade of the day for the Eagles, and the second involving a tackle. After re-acquiring Fred Johnson from the Jaguars, Kinnard become expendable, and instead he’ll serve in a similar capacity for Green Day.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-de99-dbe3-a9bb-fedb6e7d0000</guid>

      <title>Courtland Sutton thinks Marvin Mims is the Broncos’ No. 2 wide receiver.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-deb0-de13-afdc-defb241d0000</link>
      <description>That’s good news. Stuck in a part-time offensive role through two NFL seasons, Mims has teased excellent per-play efficiency, particularly as a post-catch producer. Sutton aptly notes that Mims “can make plays anywhere,” and his special teams returner showings have bagged him second- and first-team All-Pro honors. If Mims has indeed secured the No. 2 wide receiver role and will be allowed to remain on the field in two-wide receiver sets, we could see a breakout season from him in 2025. His PPR WR55, 13th-round ADP makes him a low-risk, high-reward draft pick.</description>
