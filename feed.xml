      <title>Jaguars WR Brian Thomas, Jr. said his chemistry with Trevor Lawrence grew throughout the offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b14-de13-afdd-4fdf69040000</link>
      <description>It’s good to hear from the second-year wideout after Lawrence struggled in 2024 and missed seven games with shoulder and head injuries. “I feel like we’ve definitely got a lot closer, whether it’s football or off the field, like all the little things,” Thomas said of his relationship with Lawrence. “I feel like our chemistry is growing on the field, and I feel like it’s going to continue to grow throughout the season.” The offseason work between Thomas and Lawrence wasn’t without some hiccups, however. Thomas was seen during training camp “punching a padded wall or kicking a football” after offensive miscues and miscommunications between quarterback and pass catcher. Head coach Liam Coen has said Thomas — who went for 1,282 yards and ten touchdowns as a rookie — will play more from the slot in 2025. That’s a positive development for Thomas, who was the league’s third most efficient pass catcher from the slot in 2024.</description>

      <title>Jaxson Dart will start the regular season as the Giants’ No. 2 quarterback.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b42-dbe3-a9bb-3b53511a0000</link>
      <description>Dart was bumped to the QB2 spot behind Russell Wilson ahead of the team’s Week 1 matchup against the Commanders following a highly impressive training camp and preseason. Dart completed 32 of 46 passes for 372 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions over three preseason affairs. His adjusted completion rate was 78 percent, according to Pro Football Focus. Dart is sure to take over as New York’s starter sometime this season, perhaps in the first half of the season should Wilson struggle. Dart should be rostered in all superflex leagues and can be stashed on benches in 14-team one-QB formats.</description>

      <title>Titans signed LB Kyzir White, formerly of the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b46-dbe3-a9bb-3b5770110000</link>
      <description>White last season in Arizona had 137 tackles, 2.5 sacks and 9 tackles for a loss as a starting linebacker. He should instantly become a starter in a Tennessee defense that struggled to stop the run and the pass in 2024, and should struggle once again in 2025. White, 29, has 7.5 sacks over 92 regular season games since entering the NFL in 2018.</description>

      <title>Bills signed WR Gabe Davis, formerly of the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b54-de13-afdd-4fdff1350000</link>
      <description>Davis will reunite with Josh Allen and the Bills after a disastrous 2024 season in Jacksonville, where he managed 20 catches for 239 yards and two touchdowns over ten games before injuring his knee. Davis is expected to continue rehabbing that knee injury ahead of Week 1, and could be sidelined for the first part of the regular season. Before he left for the Jaguars, Davis scored 27 touchdowns over four seasons with the Bills as Allen’s primary downfield threat. Davis, 26, will likely function as a rotational receiver in the Buffalo offense this season unless the team struggles with wideout injuries.</description>

      <title>Titans OC Nick Holz said Tony Pollard is in a “good place” but added “we’ll have to get other backs in the mix, whether it’s Julius Chestnut or Kalel Mullings.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b60-de13-afdd-4feb4f3d0000</link>
      <description>Tennessee gave Pollard a 1980s style workload while Tyjae Spears was sidelined last year and rarely used Chestnut, so we’d wager we’ll see Mullings as the main backup on non-passing downs while Spears nurses his high-ankle sprain. Pollard should still see the overwhelming majority of the work, just bet on it being more like 75 percent of the snaps than 80 or 90 percent.</description>

      <title>Steelers RB Kaleb Johnson is listed behind Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell on the team’s official depth chart.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b6f-de13-afdd-4fefe0bc0000</link>
      <description>We’d expect Johnson to be mixed in and play a bigger part at some point this season, but for now at least it appears he’ll have only a minor role in the rushing attack. With Warren recently signed to an extension and Johnson off to a relatively slow start in taking a share of the backfield, Johnson’s fantasy stock has declined precipitously since the draft. He’s still the best between-the-tackles fit the team has, so we’d bet he creates a role for himself eventually in 2025.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zach Berman believes DeVonta Smith could “near” his 2022 totals of 95 catches for 1,196 yards and seven touchdowns in 2025.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b8f-d332-a1fd-9fbf02460000</link>
      <description>“Look for an uptick in production from Smith,” Berman writes. It certainly would make some sense for the Eagles to throw more in 2025 so long as Saquon Barkley actually takes a regression step somewhere along the line, though that obviously is not guaranteed. Smith’s lengthy injury history causes fantasy football managers their own pains, but it’s hard to deny that there’s a path for him to improve on last year’s numbers — at the very least.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Joe Buscaglia believes “it’s fair to expect more of the same from [Dalton] Kincaid’s early 2024 role to begin 2025.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b96-de13-afdd-4fdf99670000</link>
      <description>In fact, Buscaglia believes it is “possibly complicated even more for Kincaid, as fifth-round rookie Jackson Hawes has had an impressive camp as a blocker, and if active, could get more playing time than former third tight end Quintin Morris” did in 2024. We’d put Kincaid firmly on the TE1 borderline at this point. You can probably do better than starting him against the Ravens in Week 1.</description>

      <title>Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said Stefon Diggs (knee) will play in Week 1 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0b9c-de13-afdd-4fdfd4ea0000</link>
      <description>Diggs never really looked like he’d be sidelined as he participated heavily in training camp, but after a summer of optimistic updates, we now have confirmation that he’ll play in Week 1. He should be fired up as a WR2/WR3 in Week 1 against the Raiders, who have one of the barest cornerback cupboards in the NFL. A big game wouldn’t be surprising.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zach Rosenblatt believes the Jets might “need” Arian Smith to have “a significant role ... quickly.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0bb6-dbe3-a9bb-3bf7e8ac0000</link>
      <description>“It’s a tall order to bank on a fourth-round rookie,” Rosenblatt writes, then notes that unless the Jets make a trade or acquire some outside help, they probably don’t have much upside at the position beyond Smith. Smith has enough speed to hit a huge play here or there, but we’d be surprised given the run-heavy direction of the offense if the Jets found a significant fantasy contributor at receiver outside of Garrett Wilson. Still, we can’t completely dismiss Smith’s chances if he creates a big role for himself early.</description>
