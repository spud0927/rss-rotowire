      <title>Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said “initial news is really positive” on LG Grey Zabel’s knee injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-939f-d673-a39e-b79f635e0000</link>
      <description>Zabel left Week 11’s loss to the Rams after 74 snaps (they played 84, if that seems high for a mid-game exit) and did not return. The rookie left guard has struggled as a run blocker early in his career, but has put up a 60.2 PFF pass block grade.</description>

      <title>Falcons coach Raheem Morris said “it’s fair to say [the offense will] look different” with Kirk Cousins as the starter.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93a2-d713-ad9e-fff60f5f0000</link>
      <description>Cousins has made three disastrous appearances this year, combining for 250 passing yards, no touchdowns, and no picks in 52 attempts. With Drake London reportedly to be sidelined in Week 12 against the Saints, look for the Falcons to lean heavily into the running game. Cousins is one of several quarterbacks competing for the bottom rung of the superflex ranks in Week 12 with four teams on bye.</description>

      <title>Packers HC Matt LaFleur said Josh Jacobs is dealing with a knee contusion.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9392-d1e7-a1fa-dbfa1eed0000</link>
      <description>When asked if there was a chance Jacobs could play in Week 12 against the Vikings, LaFleur said, “Potentially. We’ll see where he’s at.” Jacobs is not a candidate for injured reserve, meaning any potential absence should fall inside the four-game minimum that’s required of any player who is placed on IR. Jacobs is reportedly dealing with a decent amount of swelling due to the hard blow dealt to his knee by the turf at MetLife Stadium. If Jacobs is unable to go in Week 12, Emanuel Wilson will be in line to handle the majority of the backfield touches.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports the Broncos are “optimistic” that Patrick Surtain (pectoral) can return after their Week 12 bye.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93b2-d1e7-a1fa-dbfa10830000</link>
      <description>Ditto Alex Singleton (illness), who had surgery aimed to remove testicular cancer that feels a little bigger than the (illness) tag implies. These would be two major defensive pieces back for the stretch run. It’s possible each of them return for Week 13 against the Commanders.</description>

      <title>49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said K Eddy Pineiro (hamstring) has a strain and is “week to week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93b5-d45b-affe-d7b7b81a0000</link>
      <description>The 49ers will have a kicker workout on Tuesday or Wednesday. Given the 49ers’ offensive firepower and how often Shanahan is willing to settle for field goals, whoever the 49ers sign could be worthy of fantasy consideration in Week 12 against the Panthers.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93b5-d45b-affe-d7b7b81a0000</guid>

      <title>49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said LB Tatum Bethune (ankle) has a high-ankle sprain and will miss “a few” weeks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93b7-d673-a39e-b7b78ba00000</link>
      <description>Curtis Robinson was the main replacement for Bethune, who left Week 11’s game against the Cardinals after 24 snaps. Bethune, who took the middle linebacker mantle for the injured Fred Warner, played some pretty decent run defense as a fill-in. He’s expected to avoid injured reserve at this time.</description>

      <title>Bengals WR Ja’Marr Chase has been suspended for one game for spitting on Steelers DB Jalen Ramsey.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93bd-d713-ad9e-fffd14a00000</link>
      <description>Tape don’t lie. Shortly after he denied spitting on Ramsey in Week 11’s loss to the Steelers, videos emerged that clearly showed Chase spitting on Ramsey during a scuffle between the two in the fourth quarter. Ramsey was ejected for punching Chase following the incident, but the league appears to have sided with him in this matter. Chase can and will appeal the league’s decision to suspend him if he chooses to do so, but the evidence is pretty convincing. Chase will miss Week 12’s game against the Patriots if the suspension is upheld.</description>

      <title>Rams S Quentin Lake (elbow) will be “sidelined for an undetermined amount of time.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93c0-d673-a39e-b7d1f7820000</link>
      <description>The Rams are having testing done on Lake’s elbow and have said it’s possible that he’ll be placed on injured reserve. Sean McVay said he was “bummed out for him,” which seems to forecast a significant injury. Lake played 32 snaps in Week 11’s win over the Seahawks, with Jaylen McCollough and Josh Wallace getting extra work after he left.</description>

      <title>Bengals HC Zac Taylor said Trey Hendrickson (hip) is doubtful for Week 12 against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93e2-d45b-affe-d7f6521f0000</link>
      <description>Taylor said the same of Hendrickson at the start of last week before the star pass rusher was eventually ruled out. It sounds as if Hendrickson is a near lock to miss his third-straight game with this injury, which will have sidelined him for nearly a month by the time Sunday’s game against the Patriots comes around. The decision not to place Hendrickson on IR would suggest he could have a shot at returning in Week 13 against the Ravens, although we’ll wait to see how practice unfolds before drawing any conclusions.</description>

      <title>Commanders signed K Jake Moody, formerly of the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-93eb-d673-a39e-b7fbb3720000</link>
      <description>A former third-round pick of the Niners back in 2023, Moody was waived by the 49ers for missing two kicks in Week 1’s win over the 49ers. The third-year kicker missed a whopping 10 kicks last season, but has gone 8-for-9 on his attempts in two games with the Bears, although he notably hasn’t attempted a field goal from 50-plus yards this season. Moody replaces Matt Gay, whose struggles primarily came from distances of 50-plus yards. If the goal is to find a kicker with more range, it seems unlikely that Moody will prove to be the difference-maker the Commanders are looking for. For his career, Moody is 6-for-12 on attempts from 50-plus yards.</description>
