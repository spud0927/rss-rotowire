      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports the Chargers hired Adam Gase “as an assistant focusing on the passing game.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-43a7-d042-afbc-7ff76e7e0000</link>
      <description>Cool. Gase took a five-year hiatus from coaching after a failed two-year stint with the Jets (2019 to 2020), which came after a failed head coaching stint with the Dolphins (2016 to 2018). The 47-year-old coach will now get a chance to work with Justin Herbert in his new role, in hopes of rebuilding his image. It’s hard to imagine Gase ever getting another head coaching job, but it will be interesting to see if he can again rise through the ranks after one of the more forgettable five-year stretches for any coach.</description>

      <title>Browns requested an interview with Panthers defensive passing game coordinator Jonathan Cooley for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-43c4-d629-a1bc-f3ddd43a0000</link>
      <description>Cooley joined the Panthers in 2023 as their secondary/cornerbacks coach before working his way up to his current position. Prior to joining the Panthers, he worked as a coach with the Rams. Cooley helped oversee a defense that ranked 15th in points allowed last season, while the secondary allowed the seventh-fewest touchdown passes (20) and picked off the eighth-most passes (15) in the league.</description>

      <title>Speaking on The Pat McAfee Show, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “there will be a push this offseason to extend the NFL trade limits from three years of draft picks to five.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-43d3-d629-a1bc-f3dfc3da0000</link>
      <description>Under the current format, teams are not permitted to trade picks that are more than three years out from the current season — meaning any pick trading that may take place in 2026 couldn’t extend beyond the 2028 season. The push to expand this limit to five years would give teams more to offer in trades, but could also further set back teams who use those picks to acquire players in what prove to be bad trades down the line. We’ll see how much support this expansion gets in the coming months, but with the discussion set to be on the table, it wouldn’t be surprising if a change was made sooner or later.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports the Browns requested an interview with Falcons defensive pass-game coordinator Mike Rutenberg for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-43d8-d042-afbc-7fda66f30000</link>
      <description>Rutenberg was a finalist for the Titans’ defensive coordinator job but was passed over for Gus Bradley. The 44-year-old coach joined the Falcons in 2025 after spending the previous four seasons with the Jets. Rutenberg has nearly 20 year’s worth of experience as a coach in the NFL but has never held a coordinator position.</description>

      <title>Former Chargers S Nasir Adderley announced on Instagram that he plans to unretire and return next season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-44a0-d355-a5bd-cff4932b0000</link>
      <description>Adderley was a second-round pick of the Chargers back in 2019 and surprised everyone with his decision to retire in 2023. Now, Adderley announced on his social media that he plans to attempt a comeback in 2026. Adderley will be 29 at the start of next season and totaled 232 tackles, three interceptions, and 12 pass breakups over 50 games in his career. He was a free agent at the time of his announcement and will be free to sign with any team willing to take a shot on him this offseason. Given his lengthy absence, Adderley will likely need to sign a one-year prove-it deal to join a team, but he was a quality starter who could be of interest to several teams if he’s able to return to form.</description>

      <title>49ers DL Keion White was shot in the ankle early Monday morning in downtown San Francisco.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4507-d629-a1bc-f51f1cfd0000</link>
      <description>The team reported late Monday evening that White was in surgery after sustaining a bullet wound to his ankle earlier in the day. No amplifying information regarding the incident was provided initially, although more is sure to come out in the coming days. At least for now, it appears as if the grotesque injury to the veteran defensive lineman is not career, or life, threatening.</description>

      <title>David Njoku announced on instagram that he will not return to the Browns in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-454d-d629-a1bc-f55d33ec0000</link>
      <description>The veteran tight end took to instagram to announce that he would not be returning to Cleveland this offseason as he departs for free agency. It will mark the first year of his career not a member of the team that drafted him in 2017, ending a nine-year run with the franchise. The soon-to-be 30-year-old lost playing time in 2025 to electric rookie Harold Fannin Jr and apparently saw the writing on the wall regarding the direction of the franchise moving forward. The announcement directly contradicts previous reports that Njoku was looking to return to the Browns.</description>

      <title>Drake Maye said his shoulder injury was “significant” headed into the Super Bowl.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4826-d042-afbc-7df63cc80000</link>
      <description>Maye, following his Super Bowl meltdown against the Seahawks, said the right shoulder issue hampered his ability to throw the football against Seattle’s elite secondary. He had been on the Patriots’ injury report for two weeks ahead of the Super Bowl. Maye picked up the shoulder ailment in the Pats’ AFC title game win over the Broncos. He said he did not expect to require surgery on the shoulder. Maye will likely enter 2026 fully healthy.</description>

      <title>Patriots LT Will Campbell said he played through a torn knee ligament this season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-482c-d629-a1bc-f83d8fff0000</link>
      <description>Campbell said the injury was no excuse for his abysmal play in the postseason, including in the Patriots’ Super Bowl loss to the Seahawks. Campbell was overwhelmed by the Seattle front seven from start to finish, as Drake Maye was pressured on 29 of his 53 drop backs and sacked six times. Campbell will presumably have offseason surgery to fix the injury. Hopefully for the Patriots, Campbell — the fourth overall selection in the 2025 NFL Draft — will be better in 2026 than he was during his disastrous finish to the 2025 campaign.</description>

      <title>Deshaun Watson settled the last two sexual misconduct civil lawsuits against him.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4841-d042-afbc-7dd3d9550000</link>
      <description>The settlements come just weeks before the cases were slated to reach court. They were among the 27 civil suits filed against Watson since 2021 by women accusing him of sexual misconduct during massage appointments. Watson was fined $5 million and suspended for 11 games in 2022. His career has since tanked. Watson has suffered multiple Achilles tendon ruptures and his on-field performance has been as poor as any starting QB in the NFL over the past few years. Entering his age-31 season, Watson will compete for Cleveland’s starting job this summer.</description>
