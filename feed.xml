      <title>Colby Parkinson caught 3-of-4 targets for 62 yards in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>

      <description>Parkinson’s touchdown run finally ran out of steam over the past two weeks, but he ends the year with 43/408/8 in the regular season and another score in the playoffs. He did drop a third-down pass in this one, but was otherwise what we’ve come to expect. It’s hard to imagine that the Rams will phase him out of the offense altogether in 2026, the final year of his contract, but teams will probably have better answers for Los Angeles’ 3TE sets with a year of tape to pick over and Terrance Ferguson will be a likely breakout candidate. It all adds up to Parkinson being more of a TE2 in 2026 offseason drafts.</description>

      <title>Davis Allen was not targeted in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f878-d968-a19b-f8f9d0570000</link>
      <description>Allen went untargeted in the playoffs despite a strong snap share — he’s clearly the blocking tight end of the four-headed 3TE attack the Rams run. He enters the final year of his rookie contract in 2026 looking like a solid use of a roster spot for the Rams and someone fantasy managers should never, ever call on.</description>

      <title>Terrance Ferguson did not catch either of his two targets in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f87a-d56e-afff-fefacdc40000</link>
      <description>It’s an unsatisfying end to a season that looked to be trending up over his last three games, with a hamstring injury sandwiched around games of four, four, and five targets heading into this one. Ferguson probably won’t garner much offseason hype given the fact that the Rams very easily fed Puka Nacua and Davante Adams this year, but he has a shot to take a major step forward. He’s best-drafted as a high-end TE2 given the Rams’ 3TE shenanigans and our lack of a proof of concept for a big fantasy game, but where there’s talent and a good offensive playcaller, fantasy points aren’t hard to foresee.</description>

      <title>Tyler Higbee caught his only target for 12 yards in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f87e-d56e-afff-fefeb8e10000</link>
      <description>A free agent this offseason, the 33-year-old tight end certainly didn’t earn many targets for the Rams in 2025 despite 3TE looks being the norm. Some of that is Davante Adams and Puka Nacua, yes. Some of that is also just getting old. We’d bet on Higbee to get sniffs in free agency, but we’d be surprised if the lifelong Ram found a fantasy-favorable role in 2026.</description>

      <title>Konata Mumpfield failed to catch either of his two targets in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f881-d35e-a1bf-fdc3ad0c0000</link>
      <description>Mumpfield had an eight-target game in Davante Adams’ hamstring-related absence and certainly appears to be the main backup wideout on the outside after the Rams picked him in the seventh round of last year’s draft. He finished the year with a 10/92/1 line. There’s not an obvious fantasy vacuum for him to step into even if he managed to be the main third receiver in 2026 — especially given how successful three tight-end looks were for the Rams this year. Still, he’s an interesting dynasty bench stash after making good progress in his rookie year.</description>

      <title>Jordan Whittington was not targeted in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f884-d968-a19b-f8f5f06d0000</link>
      <description>From Weeks 1-12, the 2024 sixth-round pick was Los Angeles’ No. 3 receiver and played 52.4 percent of the Rams’ snaps. His fantasy relevancy peaked when the Rams headed to London without Puka Nacua and Whittington managed to reward managers with a 2/9 dud. Over the final five games of the season, dealing with a knee injury, he managed just 44 offensive snaps. Whittington isn’t a must-hold in dynasty leagues at this point, but it’s possible he was simply not himself while trying to play hurt. Either way, it’s hard to imagine much of a 2026 fantasy role for him here.</description>

      <title>Xavier Smith was not targeted in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f888-dc7a-af9b-ffbff0200000</link>
      <description>What Smith did do was lose his footing on a punt return, letting the ball bounce off his chest and arms and right to the Seahawks. It immediately led to a touchdown in what finished as a four-point loss. Kyren Williams replaced Smith afterwards. Smith battled Tutu Atwell for a roster spot all season and eventually won out because of his work on special teams. Welp. An exclusive rights free agent in 2026, Smith was mostly a shot-play weapon and doesn’t figure to have a real fantasy role next season.</description>

      <title>Harrison Mevis made his only field-goal attempt in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f88c-dc7a-af9b-ffbfd3f00000</link>
      <description>Mevis finishes the year 12-of-13 on field goals — missing one against the Seahawks in Week 16 — and hit all 39 of his regular season extra point attempts. He was perfect in the playoffs on five field goals and nine extra-point attempts. The 23-year-old was a find for the Rams and should enter the starting kicker conversation in most fantasy leagues that use kickers in 2026.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports Philip Rivers has withdrawn his name from consideration for the Bills’ head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-fa69-d35e-a1bf-ffebedcd0000</link>
      <description>Less than 24 hours ago, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that the interest between Rivers was“real” and “not a joke.”Now, Rivers is officially out of the search, removing himself from consideration after his first interview. This shouldn’t be an indictment on Rivers or the Bills, but it’s clear he wasn’t ready to move into full-time head-coaching duties just yet. NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo notes that a head coaching gig could be in his future but added “now isn’t the right time for him and his family.”</description>

      <title>NFL insider Jordan Schultz reports the Bills are expected to interview Broncos pass game coordinator Davis Webb for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-fa73-d968-a19b-faf31dae0000</link>
      <description>Webb doesn’t have any experience as an offensive play-caller, but he does have close ties to Buffalo. The former QB turned coach spent three seasons with the Bills from 2019 to 2021, and is a close friend of Josh Allen, which could give him an inside edge on landing the job. Webb got his start in coaching in 2023 with the Broncos as their quarterbacks coach, and added the role of pass game coordinator to his resumé this season. He’s also considered a “prime candidate” for the Raiders head-coaching job, so Webb has multiple suitors. Whether or not he lands a gig is still to be determined, but there’s no denying he’s viewed as an up-and-comer in coaching circles.</description>
