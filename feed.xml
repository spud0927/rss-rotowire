      <title>Falcons CB A.J. Terrell (hamstring) will not play in Atlanta’s Week 4 game against Washington.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8727-deb6-a7fd-d7ff9f920000</link>
      <description>Raheem Morris said that Terrell could return in Week 5, but after two straight weeks of not practicing he’s likely questionable at best for that matchup. Terrell’s a fine boundary corner who the Falcons will miss, but his absence doesn’t change much against a Commanders team that doesn’t have most of its main receiving options healthy anyway. Dee Alford will likely draw another start.</description>

      <title>Saints EDGE Chase Young (calf) won’t play in New Orleans’ Week 4 game against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8737-d95b-addb-ef7760620000</link>
      <description>Rather than place Young on injured reserve, the Saints have decided to carry him on the active roster for the first four weeks and have had him at practice one time in that span — a limited on the Wednesday of Week 1. It’s a free country. The Saints also ruled out Dillon Radunz (toe) and will have Trevor Penning (toe) active.</description>

      <title>Rams coach Sean McVay said he “feels good about [him] being able to go” when asked about WR Davante Adams (hamstring) ahead of practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-873b-dca3-a9fb-bfbb6b740000</link>
      <description>Adams will be limited in practice today, per McVay, and officially be listed as questionable. It seems likely that Adams will play based on how this sets up today, but hamstring injuries are tricky and Adams-reliant managers should have backup plans ready to go for Sunday if need be. Adams would remain on the WR2 line against the Colts if active.</description>

      <title>Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said WR Xavier Worthy (shoulder) is expected to play.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-873b-dca3-a9fb-bfbbd6bb0000</link>
      <description>Worthy will reportedly sport a harness on his injured shoulder and it seems likely that he will be limited to some sort of snap count. Decoy treatment is possible, as are a handful of plays designed to feature his speed, ideally along the sideline so he can avoid contact by stepping out of bounds post-catch. Worthy must be treated as a boom-bust WR3 option, though the Ravens are currently allowing the second-most passing yards per game (266.3).</description>

      <title>Giants WR Malik Nabers (shoulder) is not on New York’s final Week 4 injury report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8748-deb6-a7fd-d7df22430000</link>
      <description>As expected, Nabers will start and play against the Chargers in Week 4. We’re expecting some target shuffling for the Giants with Jaxson Dart running the show, but nothing that should make Nabers anything but a WR1 play at this point.</description>

      <title>Chargers ruled out RG Mekhi Becton (concussion) for Week 4 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8755-deb6-a7fd-d7dfa2c00000</link>
      <description>Neither Becton nor TE Will Dissly practiced all week. Dissly is sidelined by a knee injury, as is backup WR Derius Davis. C Bradley Bozeman was a limited participant on Thursday and Friday, nursing a back injury. Chargers RT Trey Pipkins III successfully rehabbed his knee injury to the point that he was able to practice in full over the last two days. If Pipkins can go, the Chargers have decent odds of holding their own against the Giants’ pass rush.</description>

      <title>Bears RT Darnell Wright (elbow) will not play in Chicago’s Week 4 game against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-875c-d95b-addb-ef5e7ed90000</link>
      <description>The Bears also ruled out T.J. Edwards (hamstring) and Grady Jarrett (knee), none of the three players practiced at any point this week. Edwards will be missing his second game in a row. Wright’s absence will force Chicago into it’s tackle depth, perhaps creating a debut for 2025 second-rounder Ozzy Trapillo.</description>

      <title>Bears RB D’Andre Swift (hip) is questionable for Chicago’s Week 4 game against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-875f-dca3-a9fb-bfdf22540000</link>
      <description>He got in three limited sessions to create essentially the same situation he did last week, when he played off a questionable tag against the Cowboys. Nothing that Swift has done on the field in the first three weeks has looked especially promising, but he’s a starting running back against the Raiders, so he’s on the RB2 line for Week 4.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-875f-dca3-a9fb-bfdf22540000</guid>

      <title>Bears TE Colston Loveland (hip) is questionable for Chicago’s Week 4 game against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8760-d6e9-af9d-8ff0e4ce0000</link>
      <description>He got in a limited session for the first time all week on Friday. Loveland is not a worthwhile starter in fantasy leagues at this point as his volume is simply too low, but there’s still every chance that could change this year as the Bears start to get more used to what they have in him. Loveland is merely a TE2 until we see further signs of development.</description>

      <title>Chargers ruled out TE Will Dissly (knee) for Week 4 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-873b-deb6-a7fd-d7ffbaf80000</link>
      <description>Dissly is not fantasy-relevant on his own, but his absence frees up offensive snaps for Chargers rookie TE Oronde Gadsden II, who caught five targets for 46 yards in his first career game last week. Gadsden is worth stashing in 12-team leagues to see if Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh makes good on his stated intent to give Gadsden more opportunities.</description>
