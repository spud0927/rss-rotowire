      <title>Commanders signed QB Jeff Driskel, formerly of the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-46f3-d35e-a1bf-47f375c20000</link>
      <description>Commanders beat writer Ben Standig was the first to report the move. The move to sign Driskel to the 53-man roster suggests Marcus Mariota (hand) is unlikely to play in Week 17 against the Cowboys. Driskel spent all of last season with the Commanders and should have plenty of familiarity with Kliff Kingsbury’s playbook. That said, Josh Johnson is still considered the favorite to start after taking over for Mariota in Week 16’s loss to the Eagles.</description>

      <title>Colts activated DT DeForest Buckner from injured reserve for Week 16’s game against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4708-d968-a19b-5ff96e320000</link>
      <description>As a procedural move to activate Buckner, the Colts also waived QB Brett Rypien. It was reported before the weekend that Buckner was expected to play in Week 16’s game, but the Colts made it official on Monday with his activation. Buckner has been sidelined with a neck injury since Week 9 and should provide an immediate boost to a defense that ranks 22nd in total yards allowed but has been a top-10 run-stopping unit.</description>

      <title>The NFL upheld Derick Hall’s one-game suspension for Week 17 against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-470d-d56e-afff-e7edac1a0000</link>
      <description>Hall was suspended following Week 16’s game against the Rams, in which he could be seen blatantly stepping on RG Kevin Dotson’s leg, which resulted in Dotson being carted from the field. Hall will miss Week 17’s game against the Panthers.</description>

      <title>Commanders HC Dan Quinn said the team has not ruled out the possibility of Marcus Mariota (hand/quad) playing in Week 17 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4711-d56e-afff-e7f9e9ce0000</link>
      <description>Quinn said the team is still evaluating the injuries to Mariota’s throwing hand and quad. While that may be the case, we also can’t overlook the fact that the Commanders signed QB Jeff Driskel off the Cardinals’ practice squad earlier today, a move that suggests they are preparing to be a man down at QB this week. We’ll see where things go from here, but with a short week to prep for Thursday’s game against the Cowboys, it wouldn’t be surprising if Josh Johnson made the start while Driskel served as his backup.</description>

      <title>Commanders placed OG Sam Cosmi (concussion) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4720-d56e-afff-e7e85fb50000</link>
      <description>Cosmi’s season will come to an end following this move. The veteran right guard appeared in nine games for the Commanders this season after rehabbing from a torn ACL he suffered in last year’s NFC Divisional Round. One of the better guards in the league since being drafted in 2021, Cosmi earned a PFF grade of 76.3 this season while playing on 545 offensive snaps. He is expected to be replaced by Andrew Wylie for the final two weeks of the season.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports the Cardinals fear CB Garrett Williams suffered a torn Achilles in Week 16’s loss to the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4734-d56e-afff-e7fc95200000</link>
      <description>Williams exited Sunday’s game against the Falcons with a non-contact Achilles injury and had to be carted from the field. The third-year vet will undergo an MRI to confirm, but the injury had the look of a season-ender long before this report. Williams has started 21 of the 26 games he’s appeared in over the last two seasons for the Cardinals and has tallied five pass breakups and one interception this year.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Gardner Minshew did not suffer a torn ACL in Week 16’s loss to the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4775-d968-a19b-5ff540560000</link>
      <description>Minshew is still dealing with a knee injury, but the veteran quarterback avoided the worst in Sunday’s loss. Minshew threw for just 15 yards on eight pass attempts against the Titans and will miss Sunday’s game against the Broncos. The Chiefs have already signed QB Shane Buechele off the Bills’ practice squad. He will presumably serve as the team’s QB2 behind Chris Oladokun on Thursday.</description>

      <title>49ers activated EDGE Yetur Gross-Matos (hamstring) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-478b-d968-a19b-5ffb1d6e0000</link>
      <description>He’ll go back to his rotational pass-rush role for a team that could desperately use some juice with Nick Bosa and Mychal Williams lost for the season. Gross-Matos had played five games before suffering the injury, being held sackless in that time.</description>

      <title>Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Lamar Jackson (back) has a “significant” contusion and is “day-to-day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-478d-dc7a-af9b-cfbf018a0000</link>
      <description>“He’s in there getting treatment,” Harbaugh helpfully added. Jackson’s status for Week 17 is probably in some doubt at this point, but we’d be surprised if he didn’t try to give it a go against the Packers given the Ravens need to win to have a chance to win the AFC North. Now, whether fantasy managers should trust him at this point is — and we can’t believe we’re typing this — perhaps a different story.</description>

      <title>Chargers LB Denzel Perryman has been suspended for two games for repeated violations of playing rules intended to protect the health and safety of players.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-478c-d968-a19b-5ffd3a860000</link>
      <description>This is not the first time Perryman has been suspended for multiple games. In 2023, he was also suspended for two games for repeated violations of too many hits, where he initiated contact with his helmet. The veteran linebacker can appeal his suspension, but if it is upheld, he would be sidelined for Weeks 17 and 18. Perryman has started all 10 games he’s appeared in this season, totaling 47 tackles, four TFLs, and three pass breakups.</description>
