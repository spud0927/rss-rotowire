      <title>Christian Watson caught 2-of-4 targets for 45 yards in the Packers’ Week 10 loss to the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7163-d673-a39e-f5f3c3010000</link>
      <description>The headline should summarize Green Bay’s offensive performance from this one. The team managed only 262 yards of total offense and failed to score until under five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, with a Jordan Love fumble in the red zone to end the first half ultimately proving the difference in a tightly contest, 10-7 loss. Watson was not supposed to be this involved immediately after returning from a torn ACL suffered in Week 18 of the 2024 season, but mounting injuries have made it a necessity. The team played without Tucker Kraft, who will miss the rest of the season his own torn ACL, and rookie wide receiver Matthew Golden in this one and also lost Romeo Doubs to a chest injury in the third quarter. Watson could be asked to step up further when the team travels to face the Giants in Week 11.</description>

      <title>Dontayvion Wicks caught 4-of-8 targets for 38 yards in the Packers’ Week 10 loss to the Eagles.</title>

      <description>Wicks saw the most snaps for a team playing without Tucker Kraft and Matthew Golden, stepping into the lead receiver role with the departure of Romeo Doubs early in the third quarter. He made a couple nice grabs but also committed one drop, appearing to be on the wrong page as quarterback Jordan Love on two other incompletions. That continues to be par for the Wicks course as the third-year receiver consistently alternates between flashes of brilliance and mental mistakes. Even so, he could be called on at an elevated rate once more when the Packers take on the reeling Giants in Week 11, pending multiple injury statuses.</description>

      <title>Luke Musgrave caught all three targets for 23 yards in the Packers’ Week 10 loss to the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-716a-d713-ad9e-7d7e88a80000</link>
      <description>Musgrave failed to live up to the lofty shoes he is filling the Green Bay offense following the season-ending injury to Tucker Kraft, used mostly as a blocker in a game the Packers focused their efforts on the ground game. His next chance to return usable counting stats comes in Week 11 against a reeling Giants team that just fired its head coach.</description>

      <title>49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Brandon Aiyuk’s practice window ahead of Week 11.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-6bed-d713-ad9e-6ffdeb380000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Adam Shefter reported last week that AIyuk — coming back from a catastrophic 2024 knee injury — is expected to return to the Niners lineup at some point this season. That might mean a December return if Aiyuk’s practice window is not opened in the next week or two. The team has said Aiyuk’s recovery has been more complicated than expected. Until he returns, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall — who could return from a knee injury in Week 11 — will operate as the Niners’ top two wideouts.</description>

      <title>Browns won’t open Deshaun Watson’s 21-day practice window ahead of Week 11.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7346-d673-a39e-f7d719300000</link>
      <description>Watson, according to Cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot, has made “excellent progress” in recovering from his re-ruptured Achilles tendon but won’t start practicing this week. Cabot said Watson “must first pass his medical exams before being permitted to practice. Once he’s cleared, the Browns must be reasonably sure he’ll be ready for action before they open the window.” Browns QBs coach Bill Musgrave said Watson, 29, is determined to return to game action one day. “I know he wants to play a lot of football again,” Musgrave said. “He feels like he’s got a lot of tread left on his tires.” There remains very little chance Watson, who has played 19 games since the start of the 2022 season, will suit up for Cleveland in 2025. Dillon Gabriel will be under center in Week 11 against the Ravens.</description>

      <title>Joe Burrow (toe) said he’s targeting a Week 13 return to game action.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-73af-d1e7-a1fa-7bef78600000</link>
      <description>The oft-injured Burrow, who suffered his toe injury in Week 2, said the Bengals’ record and postseason hopes could factor into whether he returns this season. “We’ll see how these next couple weeks go,” Burrow said in his first news conference since the injury. “There’s a lot that goes into it. There’s a lot of variables that you have to consider.” Burrow on Monday practiced for the first time since September, “throwing passes to receivers not facing any defenders,” according to ESPN’s Ben Baby. Burrow, Baby said, “sported a different pair of shoes during his limited practice and acknowledged there is additional hardware in his cleats.” Joe Flacco is set to start Week 11 against the Steelers. Burrow should be rostered in all fantasy formats in case he returns in the season’s final month.</description>

      <title>Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said RB Jaylen Warren could see more touches in the coming weeks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-73ee-d1e7-a1fa-7bee11500000</link>
      <description>Tomlin said the only thing that stopped Warren from exceeding the 18 touches he saw in Week 10 against the Chargers was game script and the Steelers’ inability to convert third downs. With shortened drives, Warren’s workload was not nearly as big as it could have been, Tomlin suggested in his Tuesday press conference. “We win more third downs, Jaylen [Warren] will get more touches,” he said. Warren accounted for 41 percent of the Steelers’ offensive production in Week 10’s loss while losing out to Kenneth Gainwell on third down opportunities. That, Tomlin said, would continue. Warren will be a top-12 fantasy play in Week 11 against an abysmal Bengals front seven.</description>

      <title>Raiders placed G Jackson Powers-Johnson (ankle) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-73ff-d673-a39e-f7ffe6000000</link>
      <description>It’s a blow to the Vegas offensive line. Powers-Johnson suffered his ankle injury in Week 10 against the Broncos and did not return to the game. Pro Football Focus has graded Powers-Johnson as the NFL’s 44th best pass blocking guard this season and the league’s 24th best run blocking guard. The Raiders have the fourth worst rushing success rate this season.</description>

      <title>Raiders signed K Greg Joseph to the team’s practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7405-d45b-affe-7597a11e0000</link>
      <description>The move comes after Daniel Carlson missed a critical field goal in Week 10’s narrow loss to the Broncos. Carlson has made just 12 of his 16 field goal tries this season while missing one extra point. It looks like the Raiders could be ready to move on from Carlson if he misses a kick in Week 11 against the Cowboys. Joseph appeared in eight games in 2024, attempting 20 field goals and converting 16 of them.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Rob Demovsky reports Packers C Elgton Jenkins (leg) suffered a fracture in Week 10’s loss to Philadelphia.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7439-d1e7-a1fa-7efbb4020000</link>
      <description>Packers coach Matt LaFleur is on record saying that the injury “doesn’t sound promising.” Jenkins sounds like a candidate to spend some time on injured reserve. Sean Rhyan replaced Jenkins at center and figures to be the replacement in the short term.</description>
