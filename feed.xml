      <title>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo believes the Eagles could rest some starters in Week 18 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6f8e-dc7a-af9b-efbf3e700000</link>
      <description>The Eagles could climb as high as the No. 2 seed in the NFC with a victory and a Lions win over Chicago, and Garafolo believes they could beat Washington with some of their key starters resting for the postseason. That could include Jalen Hurts, which would mean Tanner McKee could see significant playing time against a Commanders defense being bludgeoned by opposing QBs. If Saquon Barkley sits, Tank Bigsby — who has been ultra efficient as an Eagle — could see a full workload against the Swiss cheese Washington run defense. It’s a situation to monitor for fantasy managers playing in Week 18 championships.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Colts QB Riley Leonard will start in Week 18.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6f9b-d56e-afff-effba31d0000</link>
      <description>With their season over, the Colts will see what they have in Leonard, the 189th pick in the 2025 NFL Draft out of Notre Dame. Leonard completed 18 of 29 attempts for 145 yards and an interception against the Jaguars in Week 14 after Daniel Jones went down — a performance that led head coach Shane Steichen to sign 44-year-old Philip Rivers as a desperation measure. Leonard completed 61 percent of his passes for 365 yards, one touchdown, and one interception over three preseason appearances in the summer. He took one sacks on 22 pressures in those games and ran for 58 yards on seven rushes. Leonard’s rushing could make him interesting for superflex and DFS purposes in Week 18 against the Texans.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports NFL evaluators are concerned about Cam Ward’s throwing mechanics.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6fb2-d35e-a1bf-6ff2498c0000</link>
      <description>Ward’s unorthodox delivery was hotly debated last winter ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft, when Ward, 23, went first overall to the Titans. His mechanics have been shaky at times in his miserable rookie campaign in Tennessee. “While beauty is in the eye of the beholder with a QB’s delivery, there are some around the NFL who are concerned his accuracy will have a ceiling if he doesn’t refine his mechanics,” Howe said. One NFL evaluator who spoke to Howe said Ward’s scrambling ability could compensate for his inaccuracy over the long haul (Ward ranks 31st out of 33 qualifying quarterbacks in completion rate over expected). “The great equalizer is his ability to scramble and make plays,” an NFL executive said. “Who knows if he’ll ever be strong on schedule. It’s hard to know how much it’s sustainable to make plays off schedule outside of the offense.” Perhaps a new coaching staff can clean up Ward’s iffy throwing motion ahead of the 2026 season.</description>

      <title>Patriots WR Stefon Diggs faces felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery charges.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-702e-d56e-afff-f6ee0d8e0000</link>
      <description>The alleged assault, according to Boston 25 News, took place on Tuesday, December 2, after the Patriots beat the Giants on Monday Night Football. Diggs’ attorney said Diggs is in talks with the alleged victim to settle out of court. Diggs is scheduled to be arraigned on January 23, two days before the AFC Championship Game. The Patriots issued a statement saying the team supports Diggs. “The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs,” the team said. “Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary.”</description>

      <title>Steelers TE Darnell Washington had surgery to repair his broken arm.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-703b-d56e-afff-f6fbcc640000</link>
      <description>Washington underwent surgery Monday and won’t return to the Steelers this season, even if they manage to beat the Ravens in Week 18 and make the playoffs. Washington ends the 2025 season with 31 receptions on 43 targets for 364 yards and one touchdown. He was third among Pittsburgh tight ends in catches, as Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth remains involved in Arthur Smith’s tight end-heavy offensive scheme. With Washington sidelined, Freiermuth would seem to be the main beneficiary. Both Smith and Freiermuth have a 48 percent route participation rate through Week 17.</description>

      <title>Rams head coach Sean McVay said the team would not rest its starters in Week 18 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7056-d968-a19b-78f7bbdd0000</link>
      <description>It’s hard to believe McVay would risk the health of key players — including Puka Nacua and Matthew Stafford — with the Rams all but locked into the No. 6 seed in the NFC after Monday night’s devastating loss to the Falcons. Perhaps the team’s starters will get a few drives before the backups come in against Arizona. That would include Jimmy Garappolo at quarterback and maybe Ronnie Rivers at running back. Keep it locked to Rotoworld for updates on which teams will rest their starters in the regular season’s final week.</description>

      <title>Cowboys waived CB Trevon Diggs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-707f-dc7a-af9b-fffffd2c0000</link>
      <description>Diggs was regarded as one of the better corners in the NFL a few years ago, but has played just 1,208 defensive snaps over the last three years while dealing with injuries. The Cowboys have seemed disinterested in employing Diggs for some time, and the only surprise is that the move happened now instead of this offseason. Diggs’ contract is out of guaranteed money after this year, so it’s possible he is claimed on waivers. Former DC Dan Quinn is in Washington, which is one possible landing spot. It’s also possible that he gets a shot with a playoff team, though it might be a little late to crack anyone’s rotation for the Wild Card round at this point.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers LT Tristan Wirfs (toe) is practicing on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70a6-d968-a19b-78f743b80000</link>
      <description>The Buccaneers face a must-win game to keep their playoff hopes alive on Saturday afternoon. Wirfs missed last week’s game with this toe injury. The fact that he’s already practicing, even if this does wind up being a limited session, points to him playing. And the Buccaneers need every ounce of healthy talent they can get for this game given the way their late season has been going.</description>

      <title>Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones “hinted” that RB Jaydon Blue could see some snaps against the Giants in Week 18.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70aa-dc7a-af9b-ffbf92b30000</link>
      <description>While the Cowboys have insisted that they’re playing their starters in Week 18, nothing in that guarantee says they’ll play most of the game. Javonte Williams (shoulder) left Week 17’s win over the Commanders, and Malik Davis is apparently also dealing with an eye injury. It’s possible that both start or get a limited runway and the Cowboys see what Blue can do, making Blue a Week 18 running back of interest. The fifth-round rookie hasn’t had a real role since October after a fumble against the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he is “more optimistic than I have been in recent weeks” about LB T.J. Watt (lung) playing in Week 18.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70ad-d56e-afff-f6ed6e480000</link>
      <description>That’s not to necessarily Watt has a good chance given the reporting we’ve already had that he’s a long shot, and the qualifier “in recent weeks” is holding up the optimism. We think Watt has a chance to play, but he’ll probably have to start practicing in full by Thursday for Tomlin to confidently plug him in for the AFC North championship on Sunday night.</description>
