      <title>Jaxon Smith-Njigba caught 9-of-12 targets for 105 yards in the Seahawks’ Week 11 loss against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8fa1-d45b-affe-dfb7db210000</link>
      <description>It was Smith-Njigba’s seventh game this season with more than 100 receiving yards. He was targeted on 26 percent of his pass routes and had one of the best catches of the NFL season — a one-handed stab near the sideline on an off-target throw from Sam Darnold. JSN’s domination of air yards and targets in the balanced Seattle offense makes him the safest player in fantasy. He’ll be an elite option against the Titans in Week 12.</description>

      <title>Andrei Iosivas caught 3-of-4 targets for 20 yards in the Bengals’ Week 11 loss to the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8fbb-d45b-affe-dfbf50d80000</link>
      <description>All three of Iosivas’ receptions came on the Bengals’ first two offensive drives. Outside of that, the third-year receiver was held in check for much of the afternoon. Iosivas has seen a slight uptick in volume since Joe Flacco took over as starter, but is far too inconsistent to warrant any fantasy consideration for Week 12 against the Patriots.</description>

      <title>Noah Fant caught 5-of-6 targets for 36 yards in the Bengals’ Week 11 loss to the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8fbe-d673-a39e-afbf38150000</link>
      <description>It was a typical receiving line for Fant, whose six targets set a new season high. Fant’s most memorable moment, unfortunately, came in the fourth quarter when he fumbled the ball late and with the game well out of reach. The fumble was then recovered by Steelers DB James Pierre, who returned it 34 yards for the Steelers’ second defensive touchdown of the day. Fant can be left on waivers ahead of Week 12’s game against the Patriots.</description>

      <title>Elijah Arroyo did not catch either of his two targets in the Seahawks’ Week 11 loss against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8fa8-d1e7-a1fa-dfea28790000</link>
      <description>Arroyo, who has more than two receptions in just one game this season, ran a route on 16 of the Seahawks’ 49 drop backs while AJ Barner was second on the team with 11 targets. He caught ten for 77 yards in a career game. It looks like Barner has taken over as the Seahawks’ top pass-catching tight end. Arroyo can be left on the waiver wire.</description>

      <title>Rashid Shaheed caught 2-of-5 targets for 27 yards in the Seahawks’ Week 11 loss against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8fd6-d45b-affe-dfd676e30000</link>
      <description>He also had one rush for two yards. Shaheed has decent utilization in his second game with the Seahawks. He logged a pass route on 36 of Sam Darnold’s 49 drop backs and nearly came down with a touchdown on an underthrown ball from Darnold in the second half. While the run-heavy nature of the Seattle offense is going to make it difficult for Shaheed to provide consistent fantasy value, he could be a WR3 in positive offensive environments. That could come as soon as Week 12 against the Titans.</description>

      <title>Zach Charbonnet had 11 rushes for 37 yards in the Seahawks’ Week 11 loss against the Rams, adding two catches for ten yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8fdd-d713-ad9e-efdd0b820000</link>
      <description>Charbonnet was on the wrong side of the Seahawks’ running back rotation in Week 11. Ken Walker led the Seattle backfield with 16 rushing attempts for 67 yards and a touchdown to go along with three catches for 44 yards. Walker held a lead in pass routes, 20 to 14, and led the backfield in targets (3). Perhaps the Seahawks are ready to use their best running back as the team’s primary rusher down the stretch. Charbonnet will be a touchdown-dependent RB3 in Week 12 against the Titans.</description>

      <description>Walker led the backfield in every category, as Zach Charboonet was limited to 37 yards on 11 rushes and saw two targets. Walker’s 16 carries were the second most of his 2025 season. Walker held a lead in pass routes, 20 to 14, and led the backfield in targets (3). He would have had a second touchdown but for a holding call that brought back a lengthy TD scamper in the second half. Walker might be emerging as the nominal lead back in the Seattle backfield — a valuable role if the Seahawks remain run heavy down the stretch. Walker should be locked into lineups next week against a miserable Tennessee defense.</description>

      <title>Tyler Higbee suffered an ankle injury in Week 11 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8feb-d713-ad9e-efff435e0000</link>
      <description>Higbee was banged up in the second half and did not return. He had one catch for 23 yards before his exit. Terrance Ferguson and Colby Parkinson split the tight end route running with Higbee sidelined. Ferguson was not targeted while Parkinson caught both of his looks for 13 yards. Neither would be fantasy relevant if Higbee were sidelined in Week 12 since Puka Nacua and Davante Adams so thoroughly dominate targets in the LA offense.</description>

      <title>Luther Burden caught 3-of-5 targets for 27 yards in the Bears’ Week 11 win against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8ff2-d713-ad9e-eff65f9b0000</link>
      <description>Burden saw more playing time than usual, logging a pass route on 23 of the Bears’ 37 drop backs. Olamide Zaccheaus, who has operated as the team’s primary slot receiver this season, ran just nine routes on the day and was not targeted. It’s a potentially significant development — one that suggests Ben Johnson and the Bears are ready to ramp up the explosive rookie, who has more than two receptions in just four games this season. Burden is a good waiver wire addition for receiver-needy fantasy teams ahead of Chicago’s Week 12 game against the Steelers.</description>

      <title>Cole Kmet caught all five of his targets for 45 yards in the Bears’ Week 11 win against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-8ff7-d45b-affe-dff755050000</link>
      <description>Kmet played ahead of rookie TE Colston Loveland. He ran 26 routes to 21 routes for Loveland in a Bears offense that has increased its usage of two tight end sets in recent weeks. Loveland caught three of his four targets for 40 yards against Minnesota. Coming into Week 11, Kmet had had four straight games with fewer than three targets. He’s only a deep-league fantasy option for now.</description>
