      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-49cc-d042-afbc-7dde9c460000</link>
      <description>New head coach Todd Monken is continuing to build his staff, hiring the 41-year-old Storer as the Browns’ new special teams coordinator. Storer spent the past four seasons as the Packers’ assistant special teams coordinator and previously served in the same role with the Raiders as well. He is a disciple of long-time NFL special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia and now gets his first special teams coordinating job.</description>

      <title>Bills signed QB Shane Buechele to a reserve-future contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4a09-d629-a1bc-fa1d02060000</link>
      <description>Buechele, 28, has spent his NFL career bouncing between the Chiefs and Bills quarterback rooms, now returning to Buffalo for the offseason. The Bills also signed WR Jalen Virgil to a reserve-future deal; he spent the 2024 season with the team. Familiar faces return to Buffalo with reserve-future deals at the start of the offseason.</description>

      <title>Ravens hired assistant special teams coach Anthony Levine as their special teams coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4a7e-d629-a1bc-fa7f46f60000</link>
      <description>Levine spent his NFL career as a special teams standout for the Ravens, joining the team as an assistant special teams coach after retirement. With Chris Horton following John Harbaugh to the Giants’ coaching staff, Baltimore had a vacancy. Head coach Jesse Minter knows Levine from his days as a defensive assistant with the Ravens and now hires the 38-year-old as his special teams coordinator.</description>

      <title>Giants hired former Titans head coach Brian Callahan as the team’s quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4cfa-d89c-a1be-efff2dad0000</link>
      <description>It’s quite the downgrade for Callahan after failing in his lone season at the helm in Tennessee. Callahan will now work with second-year QB Jaxson Dart to develop his game following a promising rookie season in which he threw for 15 touchdowns and five interceptions over 14 games, while rushing for another nine scores. Hopefully Callahan’s total inability to develop Cam Ward in Tennessee isn’t a harbinger of things to come for Dart and the Giants.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Field Yates believes Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza is “ideal” for Klint Kubiak’s offensive system.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4d45-d042-afbc-7dd70b560000</link>
      <description>Mendoza is all but certain to land with the Raiders, who have the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. After displaying “elite accuracy and overall arm talent to throw to all levels of the field” during his final season at Indiana — leading the Hoosiers to the team’s first national title — Mendoza should be a good fir for Kubiak, fresh off turning Sam Darnold into a Super Bowl winning quarterback. “Mendoza brings a strong frame and in-pocket mobility with enough creativity to handle duress out of structure,” Yates said. “And his quick-processing skills point to a successful starting NFL QB.” Even if Mendoza struggles as a rookie, he will be a major upgrade for Brock Bowers and the rest of the Vegas pass catchers.</description>

      <title>Panthers hired former Dolphins quarterbacks coach Darrell Bevell as the team’s associate head coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4d7c-d89c-a1be-efff0a7a0000</link>
      <description>Bevell will operate as the Panthers’ new offensive specialist, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. Bevell, who was the pass game coordinator and QBs coach in Miami from 2022 to 2025, will reunite with Panthers head coach Dave Canales, the wide receivers coach for the Seahawks when Bevell was the team’s offensive coordinator. After bouncing around the league for the past 20 years, Bevell will look to maximize Bryce Young’s abilities in 2026 for a Carolina offense that last season ranked 26th in EPA per play and 18th in success rate.</description>

      <title>Packers named former Raiders offensive coordinator Luke Getsy as the team’s quarterbacks coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4db3-d89c-a1be-efffed0a0000</link>
      <description>Getsy makes his return to the Packers after offensive coordinator stints with the Bears and Raiders, both of which went terribly for Getsy and his quarterbacks. In Green Bay Getsy will work with Jordan Love, who in 2025 had the league’s second best adjusted drop back EPA and a top-five drop back success rate. The Packers QB room will likely be without Malik Willis, who is reportedly being pursued by the Dolphins and Cardinals.</description>

      <title>CBS Sports’ Matt Zenitz reports the Ravens are expected to hire former Broncos wide receivers coach Keary Colbert as their wide receivers coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4ddf-d042-afbc-7ddf1e3a0000</link>
      <description>Colbert was with the Broncos for three seasons. He previously coached in the college ranks, getting most of his experience at USC as a position coach and an assistant. Colbert will lead a receiver room headlined by Zay Flowers, who just went for a career-high 1,211 yards. The hope will be that Colbert can also get more out of Rashod Bateman, who logged a pitiful 224 yards and two scores in 2025.</description>

      <title>CBS Detroit’s Rachel Hopmeyer reports former Lions OT Dan Skipper will join the team’s coaching staff.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4e4b-d89c-a1be-efdf48f20000</link>
      <description>Unsurprisingly, Hopmeyer notes that Skipper will coach the offensive linemen in some capacity, though his official title hasn’t been announced. Detroit’s long-time sixth offensive lineman hung up the cleats after the 2025 season at the age of 31. It didn’t take him long to return to football, as Skipper volunteered to coach at the East-West Shrine Bowl right after the season. Now he will stay in Detroit as a staff member.</description>
