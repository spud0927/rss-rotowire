      <title>Bears promoted senior director of player personnel Jeff King to assistant general manager.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-776e-d042-afbc-7ffe66920000</link>
      <description>King replaces former Bears assistant general manager and new Falcons general manager Ian Cunningham. Cunningham held his prior role for four seasons. King joined the NFL’s administrative ranks as a Bears scouting intern in 2015, following an eight-year playing career. He served as a pro scout from 2016-2018 before becoming the assistant director of pro scouting in 2019. He became the director of pro scouting in 2021, the co-director of player personnel in 2022 and was promoted to his prior role in 2024.</description>

      <title>Seahawks OC Brian Fleury said Seattle’s “offense will have continuity from 2025,” while implementing a dynamic run game and keeping things quarterback-friendly in the red zone.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7777-d042-afbc-7ff7f1390000</link>
      <description>Fleury’s theoretical ability to run a similar offensive system is ostensibly one reason that the Seahawks hired him. Fleury served as the 49ers’ run game coordinator and tight ends coach last season. Former Seahawks OC and new Raiders head coach Klint Kubiak served as the 49ers’ pass game coordinator in 2023. We can expect to see the Seahawks again feature shifts, motion and play action. Although Fleury has called plays defensively and for special teams, he has never done so offensively. He will do so this season, and he told reporters that he has already begun preparing to execute that assignment.</description>

      <title>Raiders hired Marquice Williams as their new senior special teams coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-77ac-d89c-a1be-ffff11270000</link>
      <description>Williams served as the Falcons’ special teams coordinator from 2021-2025. He has been coaching in the NFL since 2013, spending time with the Lions (two stints), Bears and Chargers before signing on with the Falcons.</description>

      <title>Broncos re-signed WR Michael Bandy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-77fc-d042-afbc-7ffe8ffa0000</link>
      <description>Bandy, 28, scored his first career touchdown in 2025. Good for him. Bandy typically turns in an explosive play or two in the preseason, but rarely contributes once the calendar shifts from August to September.</description>

      <title>Bears released LB Amen Ogbongbemiga.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-780e-d990-a1de-7c4ef04e0000</link>
      <description>Ogbongbemiga, 27, spent the last two seasons with the Bears after spending his first three in the NFL with the Chargers. He recorded the most tackles since his 2021 rookie season in 2025 (10) and broke up a pass for the first time in his career.</description>

      <title>Browns promoted Brandon Lynch to cornerbacks coach and pass game specialist.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7815-d629-a1bc-f81d4fce0000</link>
      <description>Lynch has served as the Browns’ cornerbacks coach for the past three seasons. He now adds pass game specialist to his title. Lynch notably interviewed for the Titans’ defensive coordinator vacancy back in 2024, then serving as a member of former Browns DC Jim Schwartz’s staff.</description>

      <title>Packers will interview former Raiders ST coordinator Tom McMahon for their special teams coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7840-d89c-a1be-ffdffaee0000</link>
      <description>McMahon was initially hired for his prior role back in 2022. He was relieved of his duties in November 2025. He has served as an NFL special teams coordinator every year, dating back to 2009, spending time with the Rams, Chiefs, Colts and Broncos. The Packers will also interview Patriots ST coordinator Cameron Achord and Saints assistant special teams coach Kyle Wilber.</description>

      <title>Raiders hired Omar Young as their new running backs coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-78a2-d89c-a1be-ffff1a020000</link>
      <description>Young spent the last two seasons coaching running backs at Iowa. He has coached with the Patriots, Bears, Packers and Browns, and also has experience at the junior college level, Division-II, FCS and FBS. He played defensive back at Willamette University and earned his bachelor’s degree at Savannah State University.</description>

      <title>Rams promoted passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase to offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7b42-d042-afbc-7fd2344e0000</link>
      <description>Scheelhaase fielded several interviews for head coaching vacancies this offseason, and was once thought to be the front-runner to land the Browns’ head coaching job. Now, the 35-year-old coach will have his hands on the offense a little more with this latest promotion. Scheelhaase first joined the Rams in 2024 as an offensive assistant and passing game specialist, and has now received promotions in back-to-back years. We assume Sean McVay will continue to call plays, but this promotion will bode well for Scheelhaase’s future as he looks to eventually make the leap to a head-coaching role in the future.</description>

      <title>Falcons GM Ian Cunningham said there are “a lot of discussions for us about the entire roster” when asked if Michael Penix (knee) would be the guaranteed starter when he returns from injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7b68-d042-afbc-7ffaf2f40000</link>
      <description>In an article written by ESPN’s Marc Raimondi, Cunningham said the team is “excited about (Penix) and what he’s doing with his rehab,” but didn’t comment on whether he would be locked in as the team’s QB1 for next season. The soon-to-be 26-year-old is rehabbing from a torn ACL he suffered in Week 11, but underwhelmed in his second season, throwing for 1,982-9-3 in the nine starts he made. For his career, Penix has completed just 59.6 percent of his passes while going 4-8 as a starter. With Kirk Cousins likely to be playing elsewhere in 2026, any competition Penix could face for the starting role will likely come from the outside via either the draft or free agency. Penix said during the Super Bowl media week that he “absolutely” expects to be ready by Week 1, but given the timing of his injury, he’ll likely have several hurdles to clear just to be ready in time for training camp. Regardless, we would expect the Falcons to address their QB room in some way this offseason.</description>
