      <title>Zay Flowers caught 4-of-6 targets for 138 yards and two touchdowns in the Ravens’ Week 18 loss to the Steelers.</title>

      <description>Flowers got behind the defense for a 50-yard touchdown connection with Lamar Jackson in the fourth quarter, and the two connected on a beautiful 64-yard throw not long after. The 25-year-old scored three touchdowns over the final two games to finish the year with five while adding 86 catches for 1,211 yards. There may be some games that frustrate, but the overall production is tough to complain about.</description>

      <title>Devontez Walker caught 2-of-2 targets for 46 yards and a touchdown in the Ravens’ Week 18 loss to the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c7a-dc7a-af9b-cfffbb6f0000</link>
      <description>Walker scored the first touchdown of the game when Lamar Jackson found him open on fourth down on the first ddrive of the game. The second-year wideout turned three of his five catches into touchdowns, which is impressive efficiency and impossible to replicate. Walker will compete for a roster spot in 2026.</description>

      <title>Isaiah Likely caught 2-of-2 targets for 32 yards in the Ravens’ Week 18 loss to the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c7b-dc7a-af9b-cfffbe820000</link>
      <description>Likely’s biggest play was a 26-yard snag late in the contest. The 25-year-old had the same amound of catches as Mark Andrews, but doubled Andrews’ 14 yards in the contest. Likely’s season was hurt by injuries — for him and for Lamar Jackson — but he’s a name to keep an eye on if he signs with a new club in 2026.</description>

      <title>Mark Andrews caught 2-of-3 targets for 14 yards in the Ravens’ Week 18 loss to the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c7c-d968-a19b-dcfdb2de0000</link>
      <description>Andrews didn’t have a role in the Ravens’ passing game; something that was said often in 2025 as he finished with a career-low 46 catches to go with five touchdowns. The 30-year-old signed a contract extension in the middle of the year, so he’ll obviously be back barring something unforeseeable with Baltimore in 2026. The positonal value helps, but it’s more likely than not that Andrews won’t be anything close to an elite option in the coming campaigns.</description>

      <title>Deandre Hopkins didn’t catch his only target in the Ravens’ Week 18 loss to the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c7d-d35e-a1bf-cdff81f40000</link>
      <description>Hopkins only target was the wideout giving up on what could have been a play downfield, but the wideout assumed Lamar Jackson was going to take off. The 33-year-old was once among the best wideouts in the game, but is just an afterthought at this stage of his career. He could be back with Baltimore if he’s comfortable with this role. Time comes for us all.</description>

      <title>Calvin Austin caught 3-of-7 targets for 55 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers’ Week 18 win over the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c7e-d56e-afff-eefe624b0000</link>
      <description>Austin was having a quiet game until a blown coverage — blown coverage is an understatement, really — allowed him to sneak into the end zone on a connect with Aaron Rodgers to give Pittsburgh a 26-24 lead and ultimately a win/playoff spot. The 26-year-old wideout will cede targets to DK Metcalf in the playoff game against the Texans, but should again see a handful or two of targets in that contest.</description>

      <title>Adam Thielen caught 3-of-6 targets for 43 yards in the Steelers’ Week 18 over the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c7f-d968-a19b-dcff7d3f0000</link>
      <description>The Steelers were getting nothing done offensively until Aaron Rodgers turned back the clock and threw a seed to Thielen for a long gain that set up their first touchdown. The 35-year-old has shown a decent rapport with Aaron Rodgers, and it’d be a surprise if he didn’t see a handful of targets again versus the Texans next week in the Wild Card Round.</description>

      <title>Marquez Valdes-Scantling caught 5-of-7 targets for 34 yards in the Steelers’ Week 18 win over the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c80-dc7a-af9b-cfbfac6e0000</link>
      <description>Scantling was wide open for what would have been a 30-plus yard gain, but Aaron Rodgers overthrew the pass. The wideout was able to haul in a decent amount of targets, but the yardage leaves a lot to be desired. MVS will be a secondary option at best for the Wild Card Round bout against the Texans.</description>

      <title>Tyler Loop made 1-of-2 field goals and all three extra-point attempts in the Ravens’ Week 18 loss to the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c8a-d968-a19b-dcfb7fff0000</link>
      <description>Loop has been one of the best kickers in football even as a rookie, but his season ends on a dour note as he missed what would have been a game-winning field goal with no time remaining. The 24-year-old shouldn’t have any issues with job security to open 2026 even with the miss, and he’ll be worthy of fantasy consideration in leagues that still employ kickers.</description>

      <title>Pat Freiermuth caught 3-of-5 passes for 51 yards in the Steelers’ Week 18 win over the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8c96-d35e-a1bf-cdd6fa100000</link>
      <description>Freiermuth did most of his damage on a 31-yard connection with Aaron Rodgers that set up a Kenneth Gainwell touchdown. The 27-year-old has been routinely catching around three passes a game for the majority of the season, and he likely will see a similar amount of targets against the Texans next Monday in the Wild Card Round.</description>
