      <title>Bengals claimed WR Ke’Shawn Williams off waivers from the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2937-d8cf-affb-bd3f19870000</link>
      <description>Williams has only played nine offensive snaps this year and was signed as a UDFA out of Indiana earlier this offseason. He’ll work on special teams for the Bengals and likely has no fantasy value barring further injuries to the Cincinnati wideout corps.</description>

      <title>Titans claimed G Garrett Dellinger off waivers from the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-293a-d8cf-affb-bd3a1fc30000</link>
      <description>He’ll join an interior line room that has watched Kevin Zeitler and Lloyd Cushenberry miss games over the past month. Dellinger was a seventh-rounder in the 2025 Draft by the Ravens. He might get a look down the stretch as the Titans wrap up the season.</description>

      <title>Bills signed K Michael Badgley to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-293c-d1bc-a3fb-ad3c2d500000</link>
      <description>With Matt Prater injured and unlikely to go this week, Badgley will be a solid streamer kicker in Week 16 as Buffalo takes on the Browns.</description>

      <title>Bears WR Rome Odunze (foot) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-294f-d005-a9bf-f97fc0ad0000</link>
      <description>It’s a walk-thru and an estimated report today, but this isn’t surprising after Ben Johnson’s ominous words for Odunze’s situation on Monday. Odunze is closer to doubtful than questionable based on Johnson saying the Bears may “need to protect him from himself” with this injury after he re-aggravated it right before game time in Week 15.</description>

      <title>Bears WR Luther Burden (ankle) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2951-d005-a9bf-f975ce330000</link>
      <description>After Ben Johnson called him day-to-day coming out of the Bears’ Week 15 game, where he left in the third quarter, Burden did not exactly assuage concerns he’d miss Saturday’s game with this DNP. Burden still has time to turn it around, and this was only an estimation, but it’s not an auspicious start to the week.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2951-d005-a9bf-f975ce330000</guid>

      <title>Packers WR Christian Watson (chest/shoulder) did not practice in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2975-d1bc-a3fb-ad754d130000</link>
      <description>Watson was injured in Week 15 against the Broncos and is now listed with both chest and shoulder injuries to open the week. His injury is not believed to be serious, but on a short week ahead of a Saturday game, it may be difficult for Watson to practice enough to play in Week 16. The Packers’ report is merely an estimate with a walkthrough practice, but Watson and Dontayvion Wicks (ankle) did not practice. The Packers’ deep passing game may be hampered if Watson and Wicks cannot play Saturday against the Bears, leaving rookie Matthew Golden some opportunities on the outside.</description>

      <title>Packers OL Zach Tom (back/knee) did not practice in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2980-d005-a9bf-f9b41cd10000</link>
      <description>Tom suffered a knee injury in Week 15 against the Broncos, but seems to have avoided a major absence. Still, the Packers’ right tackle begins the week with a DNP designation. Practicing later in the week will give him a better chance to play Saturday against the Bears.</description>

      <title>Commanders RB Chris Rodriguez (groin) was a full participant in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-298f-d1bc-a3fb-adafa9070000</link>
      <description>Rodriguez missed the Commanders’ Week 15 game against the Giants after going DNP-limited-limited in practice with the groin injury last week. Starting out the week as a full participant bodes well for his return. Rodriguez likely cuts back into Jacory Croskey-Merritt’s workload in his return, demoting both to RB3 fantasy plays at best in Week 16 against the Eagles.</description>

      <title>Commanders LT Laremy Tunsil (oblique) did not practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2992-d1bc-a3fb-adb6475e0000</link>
      <description>Tunsil suffered an oblique injury in Week 15 and his status for Week 16 is in flux. Commanders head coach Dan Quinn on Monday that Tunsil will play “if he can”, but the left tackle starts out the week not practicing. Practice reports later in the week will tell if Tunsil is good to go for Saturday against the Eagles.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2992-d1bc-a3fb-adb6475e0000</guid>

      <title>Eagles RB Saquon Barkley (stinger) did not practice in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-2995-d1bc-a3fb-adb5f9e10000</link>
      <description>Barkley popped up with a new listing on the injury report, getting a DNP designation due to a stinger. It is unclear yet how serious the injury is, as stingers indicate some kind of head/shoulder nerve pain. He starts out the week with a DNP and practice reports later in the week will tell how serious the issue is. Should Barkley miss Week 16 against the Commanders, Tank Bigsby would be next man up. Bigsby was limited on Tuesday with an illness, but is still tracking to play on Saturday.</description>
