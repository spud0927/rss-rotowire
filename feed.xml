      <title>Giants interviewed former Titans head coach Brian Callahan for their quarterbacks coach vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48c8-d629-a1bc-f8ddc60f0000</link>
      <description>Unable to even find an offensive coordinator role, Callahan’s only real door appeared to close when Dan Pitcher remained with the Bengals. The Giants would be pairing two former NFL head coaches in Callahan and offensive coordinator Matt Nagy to try to develop Jaxson Dart. The experience is about the only comforting thing about that sentence given how poorly the two did developing their young quarterbacks in their most recent opportunities.</description>

      <title>Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio reports the Steelers are “in no hurry” to get an answer from Aaron Rodgers and “definitely want” him to return for 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48cb-d042-afbc-7ddbe6830000</link>
      <description>Well here’s a whole news cycle for the next five months, anyway. Again, it’s hard to argue that there’s a better fate for the Steelers out there between the lack of non-No. 1 overall quarterbacks in this year’s draft and how diminished free agency looks this year. But if you were hoping for a quick retirement after Mike Tomlin gracefully resigned his position, we can welcome you back to the 2025 Offseason Part II. We’ll have more of the same for the next several blurbs on Rodgers.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Matt Schneidman believes Jordan Morgan will start at left tackle for the Packers in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48d8-d89c-a1be-efdf9dee0000</link>
      <description>In other words, he believes Rasheed Walker will leave in free agency — even going as far as to wonder about Walker getting the snaps at left tackle last year as being related to a potential compensatory draft pick for the Packers. Morgan had an average 62.0 PFF grade in 2025, starting two games at tackle in the regular season and one in the playoffs. He looked better at right tackle in place of the injured Zach Tom than he did at left tackle.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Turron Davenport believes “it isn’t out of the realm” for the Titans to keep Calvin Ridley and add Wan’Dale Robinson in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48db-d89c-a1be-efdf8af90000</link>
      <description>The Titans already have $100 million in cap space, so releasing Ridley wouldn’t exactly free them up to go anywhere they couldn’t already go. (Davenport admits it could still happen.) Robinson, a former Giant, would obviously be a worthwhile fit with his old head coach Brian Daboll calling plays in Tennessee. It’s very obvious that Cam Ward didn’t have enough weapons to work with last year, and while we’d stop short of calling Robinson a game changer for the Titans, he could at least help them figure out more about Ward in his second season.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Matt Barrows believes the trade market for Mac Jones will be “robust” and “there’s a good chance they’ll get an offer they can’t refuse.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48e5-d629-a1bc-f8fd914f0000</link>
      <description>Barrows concludes by saying he thinks the 49ers could get a second-round pick for Jones, or perhaps a third-round pick and a sweetener. While we don’t doubt that the 49ers think their team stability is worth a lot at quarterback — and we’ve heard both national reporters and Kyle Shanahan say recently that they don’t think they’ll move on from Jones — at some point the 49ers need to embrace the fact that they rehabbed his value from nothing and could likely do so again with a different quarterback. Given how thirsty things might get on the quarterback streets this year, we concur with Barrows that there’s a real chance Jones goes for a Day 2 pick.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Ryan McFadden believes Alec Pierce and Rashid Shaheed are players the Raiders “could target” in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48e9-d629-a1bc-f8fde9410000</link>
      <description>Part of the offensive overhaul under Klint Kubiak will be to figure out how to fix last year’s wideout room, which ended the season with Tre Tucker and a dusty Tyler Lockett getting the majority of the snaps. Franchise-tagging Pierce could be in play for the Colts. Kubiak just spent half a season with Shaheed, so that pairing has some extra juice. (Though it should be noted Shaheed didn’t exactly thrive on offense with Kubiak.)</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Joe Buscaglia believes Dawson Knox is a candidate to be released.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48f8-d042-afbc-7dfa058a0000</link>
      <description>The Bills would save $9.6 million in cap space with a release of the veteran tight end, and Jaxson Hawes played well enough in his rookie season to believe he could step into a featured role as the No. 1 blocking tight end. Given how deep the Bills are in cap hell — they project to be over the cap by $7 million before the offseason starts — lopping off Knox definitely is in play at this point. Buscaglia also projects Curtis Samuel ($6.05 million in cap savings) and Ty Johnson ($2.45 million) as potential candidates for release as the Bills look to get cap compliant.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zac Jackson believes Shedeur Sanders will get “runway to be the No. 1 quarterback for the summer and early fall.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4909-d042-afbc-7ddb17c90000</link>
      <description>To be clear, this doesn’t mean that Sanders is the long-term starter for the Browns — in fact, Jackson even says they’re probably looking at drafting another quarterback “fairly early” in this year’s draft. But it seems like the team is mostly playing its cards as if they’re getting ready for 2027, not 2026, with Deshaun Watson as “a fallback option because he has to be.” That should give Shedeur Sanders a chance to start in 2026 — he’ll need to do better than he did towards the end of 2025 to keep the job, however, incredibly funny Pro Bowl nod aside.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4909-d042-afbc-7ddb17c90000</guid>

      <title>Jets hired former Browns quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave as their quarterbacks coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4915-d89c-a1be-efdf639a0000</link>
      <description>Musgrave has coordinator experience with the Panthers, Jaguars, Vikings, Raiders, and Broncos. The 58-year-old has not called NFL plays since 2018 and has spent the last three years with the Browns. He’ll be another voice in Frank Reich’s room as the Jets try to turn their offense away from the abyss.</description>

      <title>Raiders coach Klint Kubiak said he wants EDGE Maxx Crosby “to be a part of our success going forward, there’s no doubt about that.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4919-d89c-a1be-efdf5cd00000</link>
      <description>This is mostly cold water on the idea of a Crosby trade from the team’s new head coach, but we’ll see what happens going forward here. There have been too many reports of Crosby wanting out — including one of him telling Tom Brady he’d never play for the Raiders again — to fully invest in the idea that a trade won’t happen. Still, it’s broadly good news that Crosby was at the introductory presser and had coffee with Kubiak.</description>
