      <title>Colts WR Alec Pierce (knee) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 2 against the Broncos.</title>

      <description>Whether Pierce’s downfield role returns FLEX value is a toss-up, but he will play a critical role in keeping the secondary honest as the Colts’ myriad short-to-intermediate options run routes beneath him. Pierce is a boom-bust FLEX option in a tough matchup.</description>

      <title>Colts RB Tyler Goodson (elbow) is questionable to play in Week 2 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3fa9-dc44-a9d9-3fefaf640000</link>
      <description>Goodson has a chance to play this week, but his status is clearly uncertain. He was limited through two practices before practicing in full on Friday. Whenever Goodson returns, he will go to work against DJ Giddens for the No. 2 role.</description>

      <title>Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee) was not seen practicing on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3fa9-d294-a19b-fff988b40000</link>
      <description>Bowers instead stood off to the side, again wearing a black sleeve on his left leg. The young tight end is talented enough that he probably does not need to practice in order to play, but we would have liked to have seen him practicing in some capacity today. Saints TE Juwan Johnson and Browns TE Harold Fannin Jr. were likely already nabbed off waivers this week. If they remain available, pick them up immediately. Raiders backup TE Michael Mayer is TE1-viable if Bowers cannot play on Monday night. Mayer caught 4-of-4 targets for 38 yards in Week 1.</description>

      <title>Broncos TE Evan Engram (calf) is not on Denver’s final injury report for Week 2.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3faf-d294-a19b-ffff4a2a0000</link>
      <description>He had back-to-back full sessions to finish out the week and it appears the calf injury that forced him from Week 1 isn’t serious. Engram will be on the low-end TE1 line against the Colts. The Broncos did not target him heavily before he left against the Titans, but it’s not worth panicking yet.</description>

      <title>Broncos LB Dre Greenlaw (quad) will not play in Denver’s Week 2 game against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3fb6-d86f-abdd-7fbfdaaa0000</link>
      <description>He did finally get in a limited practice session on Friday, but it wasn’t enough to sway the coaching staff. Greenlaw should have a better chance of suiting up in Week 3 given the practice session. It’s probably too soon to call him “close” to returning, but the odds are slowly going up.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers WR Chris Godwin Jr. (ankle) did not practice on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3fbe-dc44-a9d9-3ffe62340000</link>
      <description>Godwin’s downgrade could be part of the plan to ease him back in, so we are not sounding the alarm at this time. The veteran wide receiver is expected to return around Weeks 5 or 6, though we have a long way to go until then. For now, fantasy managers can assume that Godwin’s slow-paced recovery is on track until further notice. Buccaneers OT Tristan Wirfs was limited again on Friday.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (shoulder) is questionable to play in Week 2 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3fc7-da67-a99f-fff7b2e30000</link>
      <description>Jennings returned to practice on Friday, though his practice participation status has not yet been released. If he practiced in full, his questionable tag could just be a formality. Jennings will be catching passes from Mac Jones, if active, which likely hurts his ceiling a tad. If he suits up, he profiles as a solid FLEX option against the Saints.</description>

      <title>49ers LT Trent Williams (knee) is questionable to play in Week 2 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3fad-d294-a19b-fffda5390000</link>
      <description>Williams briefly exited the 49ers’ Week 1 game against the Seahawks and exhibited a slight limp as he left the field. The 37-year-old blindside protector plays through injury whenever he can, so he seemingly has decent odds of suiting up. The Saints’ pushover pass rush will be without top EDGE Chase Young (calf), though, so the 49ers may be able to sneak past this opponent without Williams.</description>

      <title>Rams RT Rob Havenstein (ankle) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 2 against the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3fcd-dc44-a9d9-3fef924e0000</link>
      <description>The Rams entered the Week 2 practice week with their right tackle, RG Kevin Dotson and LG Steve Avila nursing ankle sprains. Good news for Matthew Stafford: Havenstein and Dotson have been cleared to play. The Titans’ pass rush is hardly a game-wrecker but it’s still nice to know that Stafford will have at least four-of-five starters in front of him.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Jordan Watkins (ankle) has been removed from the injury report and will play in Week 2 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3fe7-dc44-a9d9-3fe757d50000</link>
      <description>Before injuring his ankle in mid-August, Watkins was competing for one of the team’s top-four wide receiver roles. Training camp reports indicated that the rookie looked good. Watkins is unlikely to meaningfully contribute this week but wide receiver-needy fantasy managers can stash him on benches to see how things shake out in the short term. 49ers RB Jordan James (finger) and will also make his 2025 debut this week.</description>
