      <title>Eagles OG Landon Dickerson was carted away from practice after suffering an apparent right leg injury on Sunday.</title>

      <description>Dickerson underwent surgery to fix an injury in his left knee last year. This is unrelated, but it’s not good. Dickerson remained down for some time and was ultimately transported to the locker room via the cart.</description>

      <title>Kendre Miller rushed six times for 15 yards and caught 1-of-1 targets for nine yards in the Saints’ preseason Week 1 game against the Chargers.</title>

      <description>Miller added one kickoff return for 36 yards. It was an uninspiring performance but no one played better. He notably surrendered two snaps on the opening drive to WR-to-RB convert Velus Jones. Jones rushed once for minus-one yards, caught 4-of-4 targets for 16 yards and returned two kickoffs for 73 yards.</description>

      <title>Oronde Gadsden II caught 2-of-4 targets for 15 yards in the Chargers’ preseason Week 1 game against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9681-d45c-a7fc-969b3f950000</link>
      <description>Gadsden and Tyler Conklin both logged three first-drive snaps and Conklin failed to secure his lone target. Gadsden has a long way to go before he becomes re-draft-relevant but he’s getting reps alongside Conklin, which is a good start.</description>

      <title>Tre’ Harris caught 0-of-1 targets in the Chargers’ preseason Week 1 game against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9695-d05a-adda-be97bff70000</link>
      <description>Not much to go on here. Harris played 28 snaps, including 5-of-6 on the first drive. Harris must make his mark if he wants to lock up the X-receiver role pre-Week 1.</description>

      <title>KeAndre Lambert-Smith caught 0-of-2 targets in the Chargers’ preseason Week 1 game against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-969c-df63-a199-dfbfeafc0000</link>
      <description>Lambert-Smith led the Chargers’ wide receiver corps with 30 snaps, and played 5-of-6 on the first drive. The intriguing rookie needs a bounce-back showing next week if he wants to earn an early-season role in the offense.</description>

      <title>Colts RB Khalil Herbert (undisclosed) missed practice on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-96e8-d90d-a5bd-b6fb1ae30000</link>
      <description>This is Herbert’s second missed practice. The Indy Star’s Nate Atkins commented on the matter, saying this is a “setback” for Herbert “in the RB3 battle.” Herbert is not worth stashing on fantasy benches at this time.</description>

      <title>Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said the tight end position is the offense’s “silent engine.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-96af-d45c-a7fc-96bf2bc00000</link>
      <description>The Athletic’s Mike Dugar explains, “Seattle’s offense is built around the idea of making all the run actions look like their passing concepts and vice versa.” The Seahawks need to be able to put No. 1 TE AJ Barner and veteran Eric Saubert “on opposite ends of the line of scrimmage on early downs and make it difficult for the defense to predict which direction the run might go.” Dugar adds, “Barner continues to show he’s a great athlete with soft hands and the ability to make big-time catches,” while curiously abstaining from forecasting Elijah Arroyo’s exact role, beyond emphasizing Arroyo’s demonstrated receiving abilities. Barner appears to be the favorite to lead the position group in early-season snaps. Arroyo will likely need to prove himself as a blocker in order to have a full-time role, though operating in a specialized receiver role at least remains possible.</description>

      <title>Tory Horton “continues to make plays” with the first-team offense while Marquez Valdes-Scantling “was again working a lot with the second team.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-970a-d05a-adda-bf8a07970000</link>
      <description>Horton is evidently playing well both as a field-stretcher and in the red zone. ESPN’s Brady Henderson reports that Horton “caught a red zone TD pass from Sam Darnold” on Sunday. The fifth-round rookie is making progress in his quest to relegate MVS to a backup role.</description>

      <title>Eagles LG Landon Dickerson (leg) is set to undergo an MRI on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9908-d45c-a7fc-9b1a7d170000</link>
      <description>Dickerson suffered a right leg injury during the team’s open practice on Sunday and had to be taken off the field on a cart. We don’t know much about the severity of his injury, but we will likely get the specifics when the MRI results are announced. Dickerson has been a Pro Bowler in each of the last three seasons and would be a massive loss for an Eagles offensive line that’s expected to be among the league’s best this season.</description>

      <title>Rachaad White (groin) did not practice on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-990e-d05a-adda-bb8e1ec70000</link>
      <description>We’re still waiting on an official update on White’s injury, but he was seen in shorts for the start of Monday’s practice. White suffered a groin injury in Saturday’s preseason game against the Titans and was reportedly going to undergo further testing to determine the severity of it, so it’s possible we have an update after practice. Regardless, this situation remains one to monitor, and would make Sean Tucker an interesting late-round dart throw as a handcuff to Bucky Irving if White were to miss any time in the regular season.</description>
