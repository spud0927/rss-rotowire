      <title>Jaguars EDGE Travon Walker’s wrist injury “won’t be season-ending, but it could jeopardize his status” for Week 5 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a180-dca3-a9fb-bd99f3b30000</link>
      <description>Walker reportedly met with a specialist this week regarding the wrist injury he suffered in Week 4. The fact that ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler clarified that the injury is not season-ending suggests Walker could be out beyond Week 5. It’s a tough break for the Jaguars’ defense. Walker has 14 quarterback pressures and two sacks on the year.</description>

      <title>Nico Collins (knee) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>

      <description>Collins played through the knee injury with no issues last week. We fully expect him to do so again in Week 5 against the Ravens. Collins has had a quiet start to the 2025 season for his lofty standards. He is averaging 4.5 catches for 65 yards per game, down from 5.7 for 84 in 2024. Collins gets a good matchup versus a struggling Baltimore defense this week, giving him one more shot at a WR1 ranking.</description>

      <title>Ravens LT Ronnie Stanley (ankle) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a1b0-deb6-a7fd-f3ff217f0000</link>
      <description>Stanley attempted to play through the ankle issue in Week 4 but left after just 16 snaps. Joe Noteboom took his spot in the lineup. With Lamar Jackson likely out for Week 5, the Ravens might be better off resting Stanley for a week or two so he is good to go when Baltimore’s superstar quarterback is back under center.</description>

      <title>Devontez Walker (oblique) did not practice Wednesday.</title>

      <description>Walker spiked for two touchdowns in Week 2 but hasn’t been heard from since. His absence could free up a few more routes for DeAndre Hopkins, but we don’t expect fantasy managers to be crate-digging in the receiver room with Cooper Rush as the starter for Week 5.</description>

      <title>Ravens CB Nate Wiggins (elbow) did not practice Wednesday.</title>

      <description>The injuries are piling up on both sides of the ball for Baltimore. Cornerback Marlon Humphrey is expected to be out for multiple weeks with a calf injury. Fellow corner Chidobe Awuzie and linebacker Roquan Smith were also absent from practice because of hamstring injuries. The Texans got on track last week with a 26-0 win over the Titans. They have a shot at riding that momentum to another win versus a Ravens team without multiple starting defenders and likely Lamar Jackson on the other side of the ball.</description>

      <title>Dallas Goedert (knee) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a1bb-deb6-a7fd-f3ffebd30000</link>
      <description>It’s unclear if this is the same knee issue that held him out of Week 2’s game against the Chiefs or a new injury entirely. We’re not sure which outcome is better. Either way, Goedert is now at risk of missing his second game of the season. Backup tight end Grant Calcaterra caught one pass in his absence two weeks ago and is not on the fantasy radar whether or not Goedert is healthy. The Eagles’ star receivers could see a slight uptick in targets if Goedert can’t suit up for Week 5 versus Denver.</description>

      <title>Marvin Mims (hip/ankle) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a1c1-d6e9-af9d-abd1db030000</link>
      <description>Mims remains stuck in a part-time role despite being the recipient of plenty of offseason hype from the Broncos. He made the most of his limited opportunities in Week 4 with 69 yards and a touchdown through the air plus 16 yards and another score on the ground. A limited practice suggests he will be good to go for Week 5, but don’t expect his role to change anytime soon. Mims will be a boom/bust WR5 for his upcoming matchup with the Eagles.</description>

      <title>Commanders WR Deebo Samuel (heel) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a1d8-dca3-a9fb-bdd94f040000</link>
      <description>Samuel popped up on the injury report with a heel issue which he likely suffered in Week 4, though he did finish the game. The veteran joins Terry McLaurin (quad) and Noah Brown (groin/knee) as wide receivers starting out the week not practicing. Practice reports later in the week will show if Samuel has a chance to play Week 5, but Jayden Daniels may be returning to a severely depleted pass-catching group this week.</description>

      <title>Commanders CB Mike Sainristil (knee) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a1df-d6e9-af9d-abdf430e0000</link>
      <description>Sainristil was a new addition to the injury report this week, nursing a knee issue. The 24-year-old intercepted a pass last week and is one of the team’s starting cornerbacks. If he cannot go in Week 5, the Commanders will turn to Noah Igbinoghene for help.</description>

      <title>Xavien Howard retired after nine seasons in the NFL.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a1ef-dca3-a9fb-bdfffe3e0000</link>
      <description>The Colts placed CB Xavien Howard on the reserve/retired list after a subpar four game start from the 32-year-old veteran. Howard spent last season unsigned, but had an illustrious eight seasons with the Dolphins before. He made four Pro Bowls throughout his career, tallying 95 passes defended, 29 interceptions, and 342 combined tackles through nine seasons. Howard was once one of the best cornerbacks in the league, getting a first-team All-Pro selection in 2020. He ends his NFL career after attempting to jumpstart it with the Colts, but having made a significant impact to the Dolphins teams of the late 2010s and early 2020s.</description>
