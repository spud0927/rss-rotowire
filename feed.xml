      <title>Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy (hand) has a hairline fracture and will be out for Week 17.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4c96-d968-a19b-5cf78d010000</link>
      <description>No surprise on a short week. McCarthy apparently has a chance to play in Week 18 based on Ian Rapoport’s reporting, but we can’t exactly circle that for a fact just yet. Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said McCarthy will not need surgery for the “very small” fracture, perhaps the smallest we’ve ever heard of. It’s been an injury-plagued, disastrous year for the 2024 tenth overall pick. The Vikings almost have to bring in real competition for him in 2026 based on what we’ve seen so far. Max Brosmer should be in line for a Week 17 start and can be started in superflex leagues by sadomasochistic managers.</description>

      <title>Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said Max Brosmer will start Minnesota’s Week 17 game against the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4c9e-dc7a-af9b-cfbf0c210000</link>
      <description>The Seahawks dud was understandable — they have arguably the best defense in the NFL this year. But Brosmer didn’t exactly light it up against the Giants in relief in Week 16, and the Lions play aggressive coverage. Brosmer is yet another governor on the fantasy prospects of players like Aaron Jones, Justin Jefferson, and Jordan Addison in Week 17. “Boy, we wish Carson Wentz was still healthy,” we unbelievably thought.</description>

      <title>Vikings C Ryan Kelly (concussion) will not play in Week 17.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4ca6-dc7a-af9b-cfbfff6b0000</link>
      <description>When a man who has already spent time on IR for concussions suffers another concussion in Week 16, and said man is 32 years old, the thoughts tend to be more towards “is it time for him to retire” than “can he go Week 17?” We would be surprised if Kelly played again this season. We would not be surprised if this was it for him.</description>

      <title>Lions coach Dan Campbell said Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee) still has “a little irritation” but news was positive on his injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4ca8-d968-a19b-5cf9efc40000</link>
      <description>That makes it sound like it’s preparing us for another practice DNP today, but otherwise it all sounds like good news for St. Brown and fantasy managers who will want him available for Week 17’s game against the Vikings. St. Brown would be an easy WR1 as long as he makes it to the active line, but there is probably a non-zero chance that he gets extra rest in this one, especially if the Lions are able to put Max Brosmer to bed early.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports that Jordan Mason (ankle) is “a long shot” for Week 17’s game against the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4cab-dc7a-af9b-cfbff6140000</link>
      <description>Already with one DNP and a locker room carting under his belt in the last two days, the source here isn’t telling us anything that we shouldn’t already have been thinking. The good news for Mason is that the way Fowler’s source and Kevin O’Connell (who refused to rule him out today) have been talking about him says this isn’t a major injury and that he has a chance to play in Week 18. He’s droppable for those of you with championship games in Week 17.</description>

      <title>Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Jordan Love (concussion) and Malik Willis (shoulder) will be limited in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4cb6-d35e-a1bf-4df6171f0000</link>
      <description>It’s good news for both of them, as Love appears to be going through the concussion protocol just fine and with a chance to play in Week 17. If he doesn’t, Willis will get a chance to start. If neither of them are available, we’ll watch Clayton Tune do his thing against the Ravens.</description>

      <title>Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said QB Deshaun Watson (Achilles/PUP) won’t be activated from the PUP list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4cd1-d35e-a1bf-4dd3bac60000</link>
      <description>This has been expected all along. It’s unknown how Watson factors into next year’s plan at quarterback for the Browns — CBS’ Jonathan Jones suggested he could compete for the job in training camp with Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. But his anvil of a contract is untradeable and releasing him with a post-June 1 cap hit would not save the Browns a single dollar currently after they restructured it yet again in 2025 to keep the roster in some semblance of order. It’s possible they could restructure it again in 2026 and continue kicking the can down the road so they can put a functional offensive line on the field next year. Watson’s current 2026 cap hit is $80,716,514.</description>

      <title>Bills coach Sean McDermott said Josh Allen (foot) won’t practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4ce8-d35e-a1bf-4dea46230000</link>
      <description>McDermott said that “nothing has changed” from yesterday and that Allen is expected to be available on Sunday. It’s an earlier-than-normal walkthrough practice from Buffalo as they try to give their players some semblance of a Christmas break, so we’re inclined to believe McDermott here.</description>

      <title>Bills TE Dalton Kincaid (knee) is not practicing on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4cea-dc7a-af9b-cfff82b80000</link>
      <description>This has been the new norm for Kincaid, who actually didn’t practice in either of the first two sessions of last week en route to being removed from the injury report. It’s clear he’s struggling through this injury and only managed one target against the Browns last week. We’d exercise caution on him being a sure-fire TE1 against the Eagles in Week 17.</description>

      <title>Vikings activated Ty Chandler (knee) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4cf5-dc7a-af9b-cfff82570000</link>
      <description>With Jordan Mason likely out and Aaron Jones also ailing, it’s possible that Chandler could find himself in for some real work in Week 17. Unfortunately it comes with Max Brosmer under center, but volume is volume in the fantasy world and teams that lost backs and need waiver-wire help should certainly consider dialing up Chandler tonight.</description>
