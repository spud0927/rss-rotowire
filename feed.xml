      <title>Bengals TE Tanner Hudson (concussion) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-12fc-deb1-a39b-33fe2a8d0000</link>
      <description>Hudson’s expected return bodes poorly for TE Noah Fant’s target-earning potential, though Fant should still run as the primary positional receiver. Hudson sat out in Week 7, allowing Fant to operate as a streaming TE1. Fant caught 4-of-4 targets for 44 yards and one touchdown.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Ben Baby reports that Bengals LB Logan Wilson has requested a trade.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-12ff-deb1-a39b-33ff1d890000</link>
      <description>Wilson has effectively been supplanted by rookie LBs Demetrius Knight Jr. and Barrett Carter in recent weeks, yet he ties for fourth on the team in tackles (28). Wilson could help a team in need of an early-down thumper, though he is limited as a coverage defender.</description>

      <title>Chiefs RB Brashard Smith (toe) is practicing in full for Week 8 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1302-d5d8-a3ff-fb63607e0000</link>
      <description>Smith must have picked up the toe injury in Week 7 against the Raiders, when he notched a season-high 19 touches. He is on track to play this week, while veteran RB Kareem Hunt (knee) heads in the other direction with a bone bruise. Smith is on the FLEX radar with six teams on bye this week.</description>

      <title>Cowboys CB Trevon Diggs (concussion) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1315-deb1-a39b-331f07a40000</link>
      <description>Diggs missed the Cowboys’ Week 7 game against the Commanders after suffering a concussion in some sort of at-home accident. He is seemingly unlikely to play in Week 8 against the Broncos. Cowboys S Donovan Wilson (elbow/shoulder) also remains sidelined on Thursday.</description>

      <title>Cowboys LT Tyler Guyton (glute) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1319-d5d8-a3ff-fb796f970000</link>
      <description>This is unfortunate. The Cowboys’ offensive line health had been improving as of late and this week, they are tasked with fending off the Broncos’ pass rush, keyed by EDGE Nik Bonitto, who ties for an NFL-high 10 sacks through seven weeks. Hopefully, Guyton can continue practicing on Friday.</description>

      <title>Ravens signed DE Carl Lawson, formerly of the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-131f-d5d8-a3ff-fb7fd06a0000</link>
      <description>Lawson tallied 27 quarterback pressures and six sacks in his seventh NFL season, playing as a Cowboy last year. He gives the Ravens some much-needed assistance in the pass-rush department. The Ravens’ 28.0 percent quarterback pressure rate ranks 29th among NFL defenses. Lawson will likely begin as a rotational player, and could increase his role with quality play as the season progresses.</description>

      <title>Eagles TE Dallas Goedert (calf) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1326-d5d8-a3ff-fb672dc40000</link>
      <description>Goedert should be good to go for Week 8 against the Giants, which is great news for an Eagles offense that could be without WR A.J. Brown (hamstring), who has yet to practice this week. Goedert posted season-highs in targets, reception and yards against the Giants in Week 6, catching 9-of-11 targets for 110 yards and one touchdown. He is a high-end TE1 this week.</description>

      <title>49ers QB Brock Purdy (toe) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1329-deb1-a39b-332f208c0000</link>
      <description>Purdy’s limited practice sessions continue. Until he can consistently practice in full, we expect Mac Jones to remain the starter. The 49ers are one of three NFC West teams with a 5-2 record, and undoubtedly hope to preserve their starting quarterback’s health for a playoff run. Jones is a borderline QB1/2 against the Texans this weekend.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Ricky Pearsall (knee) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1318-dab4-a3fb-9b782ef10000</link>
      <description>49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters yesterday that Pearsall has not suffered a setback of any sort. Instead, the injury has simply taken longer to heal than expected. The 49ers’ 25-year-old wide receiver initially sprained his PCL in Week 4 and has not yet resumed practicing. Jauan Jennings will operate as the team’s No. 1 wide receiver with Pearsall likely sidelined again this weekend.</description>

      <title>Chargers LT Joe Alt (ankle) is active for Week 8 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1340-dab4-a3fb-9b70ebbb0000</link>
      <description>The Chargers are also getting RT Trey Pipkins III (knee) back this evening. This is great news for QB Justin Herbert as he prepares to face the Vikings’ top-tier blitz-based defensive scheme. The Chargers declared RB Hassan Haskins, CB Nikko Reed, OLB Kyle Kennard, OL Jamaree Salyer, OT Austin Deculus, WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith and TE Will Dissly inactive for Week 8 against the Vikings. With Haskins out, the Chargers have elevated RBs Nyheim Hines and Jaret Patterson from the practice squad.</description>
