      <title>Bears GM Ryan Poles said T Ozzy Trapilo (knee) will be out “deep into next year.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-293b-d355-a5bd-af7f952a0000</link>
      <description>Trapilo suffered a torn patellar tendon against the Packers in the Wild Card round. Theo Benedet will likely be the fill-in to start the season unless the Bears want to restructure some contracts against the cap to add a depth piece they’d prefer to Benedet.</description>

      <title>Browns GM Andrew Berry said “we’re probably going to be one of the younger teams in the league” in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-293d-d89c-a1be-affffc400000</link>
      <description>Already young at quarterback, running back, and tight end, this statement reads like an admission that the Browns plan to completely retool the offensive line in 2026. Cleveland’s entire main starting line from 2025 — Joel Bitonio, Wyatt Teller, Cam Robinson, Jack Conklin, and Ethan Pocic — are all free agents. So is swingman Teven Jenkins. Bitonio, entering what would be his age-35 season, is a candidate to retire. The fact that the Browns are, per Chris Easterling, embarking on a plan that “almost assuredly lower the average age on the roster” would seem to make it plausible that they could bring back just a scant few of last year’s linemen. It would likely help keep the Browns skill positions players as “hard to trust” in fantasy football if the Browns offensive line underwent a ton of turnover, even if they upgraded at some positions.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Paul Dehner Jr. believes there’s “no realistic scenario” where EDGE Trey Hendrickson signs with the Bengals in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2951-d89c-a1be-afdf5f820000</link>
      <description>Dehner bats around the idea of a franchise tag-and-trade scenario for Hendrickson, who he projects will get something close to the $29 million per season he made in 2025 despite missing most of the year with a core muscle injury that eventually required surgery. Ultimately, both sides are probably just tired of dealing with each other after back-to-back offseasons of contentious negotiations. We’d expect the Bengals to let Hendrickson — who should be considered one of the premiere free agents this offseason — walk.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zach Berman believes A.J. Brown will seek a trade this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2956-d355-a5bd-af5656560000</link>
      <description>Berman ominously writes “it might be difficult to put toothpaste back in this tube, and there’s too much smoke here for me to answer this question differently,” though he admits that this remains just a guess. Brown figures to be one of the major turning points of the offseason for both the Eagles and the entirety of the NFL. None of the smoke that has come out about the relationship between the Eagles and Brown has looked encouraging for him staying in Philadelphia, and GM Howie Roseman would only resort to vague hypotheticals about how hard it is to find great players when asked about a potential Brown trade after the Eagles were eliminated from the playoffs.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zach Berman believes Dallas Goedert will “play elsewhere” in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-295c-d355-a5bd-af5caabf0000</link>
      <description>Goedert and the Eagles danced around a separation for most of last offseason, including trade rumors around the NFL Draft, but Philadelphia couldn’t find a real replacement for the 31-year-old tight end. An impending free agent, we’d expect Goedert to have an interesting market but he might struggle to land a multi-year deal considering his advanced age.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-295c-d355-a5bd-af5caabf0000</guid>

      <title>SNY’s Connor Hughes believes Jacoby Brissett is “a potential trade target” for the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2980-d042-afbc-7dd218010000</link>
      <description>Brissett checks the boxes of “has worked for Frank Reich before” and “is a functional NFL quarterback.” The real question is: Why would the Cardinals give him up? He averaged 240.4 yards per start and threw 23 touchdowns in just 12 starts. Arizona has reportedly been more interested in moving on from Murray than Brissett, who GM Monti Ossenfort drafted in New England and made a priority to sign last offseason. We’d be surprised if the Jets could do this without getting fleeced by Arizona.</description>

      <title>Giants hired NFL chief football administrative officer Dawn Aponte as their vice president.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-298e-d629-a1bc-b99f3d430000</link>
      <description>Aponte was interviewed for the Chargers GM job in 2024 and also has worked for the Dolphins, Browns, and Jets. Her top experience level with the Dolphins was as executive VP of football administration, so it’s likely this role will be somewhat similar to that one. The NFL will have someone else reading draft cards on Day 2, sadly.</description>

      <title>Patriots LB Robert Spillane (ankle) said he is confident he will play in Super Bowl LX against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-24ab-d042-afbc-7dfb25d20000</link>
      <description>Spillane missed time late in the regular season with the ankle issue. He played in all three playoff games but aggravated the injury during the AFC Championship game. Despite missing some time in practice, it sounds like he isn’t at risk of missing the biggest game of the year. That’s good news for New England. Spillane totaled 97 combined tackles, two interceptions, and one sack in 13 regular season games.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo called Raiders interim offensive coordinator Greg Olson a “name to watch” for the Eagles’ quarterbacks coach position.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-29f6-d89c-a1be-afff9fcc0000</link>
      <description>Scot Loeffler is currently Philly’s quarterbacks coach, but it’s possible the Eagles let him go, allowing new OC Sean Mannion to pick his replacement. In a similar vein, Olson should be let go by the Raiders once they land Klint Kubiak as their next head coach. Mannion previously played under Olson in Seattle. Per Garafolo’s sources, Mannion would be interested in reuniting with his coach in Philly.</description>

      <title>Packers GM Brian Gutekunst said Jordan Love did not require any offseason surgeries or procedures.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2a05-d355-a5bd-af5545700000</link>
      <description>Love underwent surgery on his left thumb during training camp ahead of the 2025 season. The issue cropped up in the middle of the year but never seemed to cause him much trouble. Love also injured his non-throwing shoulder. He, again, did not miss any time. Love has battled through numerous injuries over the past two seasons. The good news is that, as of now, none of them are lingering into 2026. He should have a normal offseason routine as he and the Packers look to avenge their Wild Card Round loss to the Bears.</description>
