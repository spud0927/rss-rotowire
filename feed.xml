      <title>49ers RB Christian McCaffrey (calf/rest) practiced on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3a6e-d5f6-abfd-bb7f69be0000</link>
      <description>We assume this will be a full session based on beat reporter quotes, but even if it was a limited, McCaffrey is well on track to play against the Saints on Sunday. He should get an easy RB1 workload and the 49ers will desperately need him to deliver production with George Kittle and Brock Purdy out and Jauan Jennings’ status still under some question.</description>

      <title>Falcons WR Darnell Mooney (shoulder) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3a6e-da68-ad9d-ff7e59e90000</link>
      <description>This makes five straight limited sessions for Mooney, who did not suit up in Week 1 against the Buccaneers. His continued participation seemingly puts him on track to play in Week 2 against the Vikings, but it would be great to see him practice in full on Friday. Mooney’s downfield speed would be very valuable against the Vikings’ blitz-happy defense.</description>

      <title>Quinshon Judkins (not injury related) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3a71-d214-a3b9-3e7d6be10000</link>
      <description>The Browns have been evasive on the plan for Judkins in Week 2, but a full practice is a great sign for his status from a conditioning standpoint. It’s possible the Browns slowplay Judkins as he didn’t get a training camp. We wouldn’t be relying on an instant Week 2 impact. But he is worth picking up and holding as a potential bell-cow back once the Browns are actually ready to use him.</description>

      <title>Jets TE Mason Taylor (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3a71-d5f6-abfd-bb7df9030000</link>
      <description>Taylor dealt with a high-ankle sprain during training camp and Jets head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters that Taylor recently injured the same ankle. The full diagnosis was not shared though. Taylor’s return to limited participation is a good sign. Taylor is only a bench stash at this point, having earned just one target in his NFL debut last week.</description>

      <title>Jets CB Sauce Gardner (groin) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3a77-da68-ad9d-ff7f42e90000</link>
      <description>Gardner dealt with a reported calf injury in August before appearing on the Week 1 injury report with a fibula issue. He practiced in full yesterday and was not on the injury report at all. The development suggests Gardner suffered the injury in practice today, but its severity is currently unknown. The Jets are tasked with containing the Bills’ passing game this weekend. Hopefully, Gardner is able to practice in some capacity tomorrow.</description>

      <title>Jets WR Josh Reynolds (hamstring) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3a71-da68-ad9d-ff7b54380000</link>
      <description>Reynolds is not fantasy-relevant but the Jets already possessed a terribly thin receiving corps. His three targets ranked second on the team last week. The Thursday downgrade makes it unlikely that he suits up against the Bills this weekend. Garrett Wilson should again comfortably pace the Jets in targets once again.</description>

      <title>Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3a80-dc44-a9d9-3fe6a7460000</link>
      <description>Bowers is “hoping to play” in Week 2 against the Chargers, but said that “we’ll see how it’s feeling throughout the week.” The Raiders are understandably giving Bowers an extra day off, with this week’s game scheduled for Monday night. The elite TE1’s practice participation on Friday and Saturday can tell us far more about his availability than today’s absence. In the meantime, for those who currently have Bowers in their starting lineup, stashing No. 2 TE Michael Mayer on fantasy benches is worthwhile. In Week 1, Bowers landed hard on his left knee after taking a hit to the right knee while running along the sideline. He was later seen limping with his left leg, and sported a sleeve on the left leg at today’s practice. It appears as though the fall was more of an issue than the direct hit.</description>

      <title>Eagles LG Landon Dickerson (back) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3aa9-d86f-abdd-7fbddf310000</link>
      <description>Dickerson can be considered good to go for Week 2 against the Chiefs. It’s great news for an Eagles offense that must contend with one of the NFL’s best-schemed defenses, guided by DC Steve Spagnuolo. Dickerson will be hoping to get back on track after giving up four quarterback pressures, per PFF, against the Cowboys in Week 1.</description>

      <title>Broncos TE Evan Engram (calf) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3a7f-da67-a99f-fefff90a0000</link>
      <description>The 31-year-old tight end earned four targets in Week 1 after receiving decent training camp hype. He does not need to be in starting lineups, though he can be treated as a touchdown-dependent TE1, if necessary. Myriad options exist that can likely provide increased week-to-week stability.</description>

      <title>Steelers CB Joey Porter Jr. (hamstring) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3aaf-da67-a99f-feff89f90000</link>
      <description>A second missed practice puts Porter on the wrong side of questionable. Fortunately, the Steelers still have Jalen Ramsey and Darius Slay. The Steelers face the Seahawks this week, whose only aerial threat in Week 1 was Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Cooper Kupp was a complete non-factor.</description>
