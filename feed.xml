      <title>Texans TE Brevin Jordan (leg) injured Monday at practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9b42-d90d-a5bd-bb5bc1cb0000</link>
      <description>From the words of Texans beat reporter Aaron Wilson, “He appears to be in serious pain. Lot of noise coming from the field team huddled around him. Practice halted as Brevin Jordan is hurting very badly. Inconsolable.” We’ll need official word from the team before any conclusions can be drawn, but it certainly looks like an unfortunate injury for a tight end that was attempting to come back from a lost season in 2024 due to a torn ACL.</description>

      <title>Ravens hosted RB Boston Scott for a visit over the weekend.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9b68-d05a-adda-bbea7f740000</link>
      <description>Scott is reportedly healthy and looking for the right opportunity to contribute, saying he’s in “terrific” shape. He last played in 2023, his sixth season with the Eagles, and could make sense for a team like the Ravens as a contingent third-down option and special teams contributor.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports Saints OG Will Clapp suffered “a serious foot injury that is believed to be season-ending.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9ba5-d05a-adda-bba77d8f0000</link>
      <description>Reports surfaced earlier Monday that Clapp sustained the injury but it wasn’t until Schultz’s report that we had any clue into the severity. Schultz adds that the foot injury is likely to require surgery and would keep Clapp out for the duration of the 2025 regular season, a tough blow to the veteran after he was brought in to operate as a sixth offensive lineman for the Saints. The team is awaiting final confirmation pending follow-on testing but it appears as if Clapp’s season is over before it began.</description>

      <title>James Cook practiced Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9e69-d45c-a7fc-9e7b762b0000</link>
      <description>Bills head coach Sean McDermott, meanwhile, said “things have changed” in Cook’s ongoing contract talks with the team. Tuesday would mark Cook’s first practice of training camp after he reported refused to play in last weekend’s preseason game against the Giants. It appears his hold-in is over — for now — and he could be on his way to starting Week 1 for the Bills. Cook is coming off an 18-touchdown season thanks to heavy red zone usage he did not see in his first two NFL seasons.</description>

      <title>Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said WR Darnell Mooney (shoulder) will play at some point in 2025.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9e84-df63-a199-dfaf956d0000</link>
      <description>Morris’ comments about the injured Mooney suggest the wideout could miss significant time in the regular season. “Kind of just waiting and rolling. Kind of a week-to-week basis,” Morris said of Mooney, who will miss training camp with his shoulder injury. “I feel good about getting him back healthy and ready to go. When? I don’t know. We’ll have him back healthy this year, though.” Mooney in 2024 was a mainstay in two-receiver sets and had 992 receiving yards and five touchdowns as Atlanta’s WR2. His absence would open more routes and targets for KhaDarel Hodge and Ray-Ray McCloud, the team’s primary slot receiver.</description>

      <title>Giants WR Malik Nabers (shoulder) did not practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9e89-d90d-a5bd-bedb1f4b0000</link>
      <description>Nabers said last week that it’s “part of the plan” for him to miss portions of Giants practice in the coming weeks as he deals with a shoulder issue. Jets beat writer Connor Hughes said Nabers’ Tuesday absence was “very noteworthy” and could be a sign that the star receiver is dealing with a significant injury. Hopefully Nabers can fully ramp up in the days before the team’s regular season opener against the Commanders. Last year, Nabers had 19 catches for 186 yards and one touchdown in two games against Washington.</description>

      <title>Jordan Love will undergo surgery on his left thumb.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9eab-d45c-a7fc-9ebb2cd70000</link>
      <description>The procedure will fix a ligament injury in Love’s non-throwing hand. The team hopes Love will be able to return to practice next week. “More importantly, he’ll be ready for Week 1, and that’s the most important thing,” said Packers general manager Brian Gutenkunst. “We’ll get him back in plenty of time. I don’t foresee this affecting him long term at all.” The oft-injured Love had expressed interest in running more in 2025. With the thumb issue, perhaps that’s off the table for now. Losing Love would be a massive blow for everyone in the Green Bay offense. Malik Willis would likely start for the Packers if Love misses any regular season time.</description>

      <title>Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said Christian Watson (knee) is likely to begin the regular season on the PUP list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9eb5-d90d-a5bd-beff8daf0000</link>
      <description>This confirms reporting from ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler that Watson, who suffered a torn ACL last January, will begin the year on PUP. Look for the Packers to ease Watson into the wideout rotation when he’s eligible for return from PUP. He could be a strictly situational downfield option for Jordan Love — who’s undergoing thumb surgery — with Matthew Golden reportedly emerging as Green Bay’s No. 1 wideout. Jayden Reed (foot) could also be iffy for the start of the regular season. The Packers offense is a banged-up unit.</description>

      <title>Texans TE Brevin Jordan (knee) is out for the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9edd-df63-a199-dfff7c860000</link>
      <description>Jordan sustained a gut-wrenching knee injury during Monday’s practice. He was seen writhing and screaming on the ground for several minutes and Texans teammates appeared shaken up and emotional. Jordan was coming back from an ACL injury he sustained last year and was slated to be a regular part of the team’s tight end rotation. Now his NFL career could be in jeopardy.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Jets QB Tyrod Taylor underwent knee surgery.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f11-d90d-a5bd-bf5b4f330000</link>
      <description>The team hopes Taylor will be ready for Week 1, Rapoport said. The veteran journeyman was slated to serve as Justin Fields’ backup. If he’s sidelined for the start of the regular season, Adrian Martinez or Brady Cook would be Fields’ backup. Whoever serves as New York’s QB2, Fields’ starting gig won’t be nearly as precarious as it was last year in Pittsburgh, when he was benched for reasons never fully explained.</description>
