      <title>Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said Christian Watson (knee) is likely to begin the regular season on the PUP list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9eb5-d90d-a5bd-beff8daf0000</link>
      <description>This confirms reporting from ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler that Watson, who suffered a torn ACL last January, will begin the year on PUP. Look for the Packers to ease Watson into the wideout rotation when he’s eligible for return from PUP. He could be a strictly situational downfield option for Jordan Love — who’s undergoing thumb surgery — with Matthew Golden reportedly emerging as Green Bay’s No. 1 wideout. Jayden Reed (foot) could also be iffy for the start of the regular season. The Packers offense is a banged-up unit.</description>

      <title>Texans TE Brevin Jordan (knee) is out for the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9edd-df63-a199-dfff7c860000</link>
      <description>Jordan sustained a gut-wrenching knee injury during Monday’s practice. He was seen writhing and screaming on the ground for several minutes and Texans teammates appeared shaken up and emotional. Jordan was coming back from an ACL injury he sustained last year and was slated to be a regular part of the team’s tight end rotation. Now his NFL career could be in jeopardy.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Jets QB Tyrod Taylor underwent knee surgery.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f11-d90d-a5bd-bf5b4f330000</link>
      <description>The team hopes Taylor will be ready for Week 1, Rapoport said. The veteran journeyman was slated to serve as Justin Fields’ backup. If he’s sidelined for the start of the regular season, Adrian Martinez or Brady Cook would be Fields’ backup. Whoever serves as New York’s QB2, Fields’ starting gig won’t be nearly as precarious as it was last year in Pittsburgh, when he was benched for reasons never fully explained.</description>

      <title>Matthew Stafford (back) is not practicing on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f3c-df63-a199-df3f76760000</link>
      <description>The Ammortal Chamber awaits Stafford for another day, apparently. With every day that passes sans Stafford practicing, we get a little more concerned that he won’t be ready for the opener. Jimmy Garoppolo is Los Angeles’ backup quarterback. We’ll continue to monitor what Sean McVay called a “flexible and fluid” situation on Stafford’s back.</description>

      <title>Jets coach Aaron Glenn said Allen Lazard (shoulder) will “miss a couple of weeks.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f3f-d05a-adda-bfbf79790000</link>
      <description>Lazard was spotted in a sling after the Jets’ first preseason game and has, by most accounts, been lapped by Josh Reynolds in the Jets WR2 competition. This puts his Week 1 availability into question and an IR or PUP stint is probably not out of the question as well. Lazard does not need to be held unless you’re in a wildly deep league.</description>

      <title>Romeo Doubs (back) left Tuesday’s practice with trainers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f45-df63-a199-df6fc6110000</link>
      <description>He got medical attention after coming up with a deep ball, was crouched over for a few minutes, then walked off “holding” his lower back. It’s hard to speculate on what kind of injury may have happened here based on this information, but the Packers can ill-afford to lose Doubs as they’ve already been practicing without Dontayvion Wicks and Jayden Reed. It’s all coming up Matthew Golden right now for fantasy purposes. Doubs told reporters after practice that he was okay, but we wouldn’t be surprised if he was handled gently over the next few days.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Kevin Fishbain believes that Caleb Williams “hasn’t been consistent enough” in training camp and that his accuracy “hasn’t been there like it was last summer.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f55-df63-a199-df7f8cfb0000</link>
      <description>We didn’t get to see Williams work with the 1s in Sunday’s preseason tune-up against the Dolphins, but it’s not exactly a glowing endorsement from Fishbain on the behind-the-scenes work. Fishbain also gave a “stock down” update to the entire Bears passing game, saying it “hasn’t been a smooth camp” for them. This doesn’t necessarily mean a whole lot — it’s just practice — but we’d love to be reading more positive updates on Williams and the Bears right now as we search for breakout quarterbacks at lower ADPs.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zac Jackson believes that Shedeur Sanders has “generally outplayed [Dillon] Gabriel throughout camp.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f86-d90d-a5bd-bfdfc5300000</link>
      <description>Despite this, he thinks the Browns may let Dillon Gabriel start Cleveland’s second preseason game on Saturday against the Eagles. Gabriel missed the first preseason game with a hamstring injury, but returned to 11-on-11s today. Meanwhile, Sanders is “the only one of the primary four yet to take any snaps with the No. 1 offense.” The priors have guided Cleveland so far and Gabriel remains above Sanders on the depth chart — but this looks to be a big week for Gabriel, who will have to assert himself as deserving of the No. 3 job.</description>

      <title>Mason Taylor (ankle) returned to Jets practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9fae-d05a-adda-bfae27400000</link>
      <description>Said to have been dealing with a high-ankle sprain, Taylor missed a grand total of six days of practice. Not bad. Assuming Taylor is fully healthy for the season-opener, he’ll slide in as the Jets No. 1 tight end and be a fantasy TE2 on what looks like a dire receiver depth chart outside of Garrett Wilson.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Alec Lewis believes the Vikings could keep QB Max Brosmer on their initial 53-man roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9fb0-df63-a199-dfbba2290000</link>
      <description>“Brosmer sees the field, processing the defensive picture in a way you cannot teach. Coaches have raved about his smarts behind the scenes, too. If the Vikings don’t add him to the 53-man, they’d risk losing a reliable player at the game’s most critical position,” Lewis writes. Brosmer completed 5-of-8 passes for 47 yards and a touchdown in Minnesota’s preseason opener against the Texans. This is probably just training camp hype, but Brosmer played well enough that we should at least take it somewhat seriously — and anyone who quarterbacks Minnesota’s offense as things stand currently could have fantasy value.</description>
