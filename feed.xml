      <title>A.J. Brown caught 10-of-12 targets for 132 yards and two touchdowns in the Eagles’ Week 13 loss to the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccba-d6c4-abfb-debb44950000</link>
      <description>Brown was easily the best player on the field for the Eagles on Friday, and the social media complaints should be kept to a low roar. He snagged a leading grab for his first score, and he showed off his strength by beating a tackler on a short throw for his second. That’s three touchdowns in two games for Brown, and he’s now reached 100 yards in back-to-back contests. There’s a decent chance he’ll be able to do it a third time in Week 14 against the Chargers in a Monday Night Football tilt.</description>

      <title>Luther Burden caught 4-of-6 targets for 33 yards in the Bears’ Week 13 win over the Eagles, adding a three-yard rush.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccc3-d6c4-abfb-dec3e0ee0000</link>
      <description>Burden ended up leading the Bears in receptions on a day where Caleb Williams had to deal with significant wind and also just missed on some throws. The rookie continues to see his volume increase, and there’s a lot of reason to believe in the second-round pick in the coming seasons. It’s just impossible to treat him as more than a risky FLEX play in 2025, and that’s certainly true for Week 14 against the Packers in Green Bay.</description>

      <title>Colston Loveland caught three passes for 28 yards in the Bears’ Week 13 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccc6-db57-afda-def632620000</link>
      <description>Loveland was unable to clear 40 yards; a mark he had cleared for the past four games, but it’s worth noting that he tied for the team lead in targets. It just wasn’t a day that the Bears had much success in the passing game, in part due to wind and in large part due to rushing for 281 yards. Loveland should still be a TE2 for Week 14 against the Packers.</description>

      <title>Rome Odunze caught 2-of-6 targets for 8 yards in the Bears’ Week 13 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccc8-d6c4-abfb-decb6bd50000</link>
      <description>Odunze beat an Eagles’ defender silly and was wide open for what should have been a touchdown, but Caleb Williams wasn’t able to get enough air on the throw and it bounced incomplete. The second-year wideout tied for the team lead in targets, but the wind and some shaky play at times from Williams kept the two from connecting more often than not. He’ll have a chance to rebound in Week 14, but it’s a tough matchup against the Packers in Green Bay.</description>

      <title>DJ Moore caught 2-of-5 targets for 17 yards in the Bears’ Week 13 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccca-d90e-a9da-dfcf7c690000</link>
      <description>Moore did have one rush for 10 yards, but it’s still another unimpressive line for the 28-year-old wideout. It’s disappointing after his two-touchdown effort the previous week against Pittsburgh, and a little more understandable considering the Bears ran for 281 yards with swirling winds affecting the passing game. Nevertheless, these types of games have been all too common for Moore, and he’s a risky WR3 against the Packers next week.</description>

      <title>The Ravens are expected to place LB Chandler Martin on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccca-db57-afda-defa6ae40000</link>
      <description>The undrafted rookie suffered a season-ending knee injury against the Bengals on Thursday. It is an unfortunate development for the special teams contributor. Chandler has been active for the last three games, logging three tackles in punt and kick coverage duties.</description>

      <title>Saquon Barkley rushed 13 times for 56 yards in the Eagles’ Week 13 loss to the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cccc-d90e-a9da-dfcfcd3a0000</link>
      <description>Barkley didn’t catch either of his two targets, with one being a clear drop and the other a pass that he just didn’t get his head turned around in time to bring in. The 56 yards are more than double the ugly 22-yard game he had against the Cowboys in Week 13, but still a massive disappointment. Unfortunately, this has been far more common than could have been anticipated, and while there are five weeks to go, this appears to be a lost season for the 28-year-old. He’s back in action after an extended rest against the Chargers on Monday Night Football in Week 14.</description>

      <title>DeVonta Smith caught 5-of-8 targets for 48 yards in the Eagles’ Week 13 loss to the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccd1-d82c-a79a-ffd535350000</link>
      <description>Smith and Jalen Hurts connected on a 30-yard pass early in the contest, and after that, it was all dink-and-dunk between the two. It’s been a feast or famine type year for the wideout in 2025, with this one squarely in the middle at best. Smith will remain a high-end WR3 — if there is such a thing — for Week 14 against the Chargers.</description>

      <title>Dallas Goedert caught 2-of-4 targets for 27 yards in the Eagles’ Week 13 loss to the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccd4-db57-afda-def6434b0000</link>
      <description>Goedert was held to just two catches for the third consecutive weeks as the Eagles’ offense continues to disappoint at unanticipated — before the season, anyway — levels. The 30-year-old tight end is now off the TE1 radar going forward, including a Week 14 bout against the Chargers.</description>

      <title>Cairo Santos hit his only field goal attempt and went 3-for-3 on extra points in the Bears’ Week 13 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ccd6-d6c4-abfb-ded7b1d80000</link>
      <description>Santos had no trouble dealing with the swirling winds in Philadelphia and connected on a 30-yard attempt to give Chicago a 10-3 lead. The veteran kicker has been solid in 2025 while making 18-of-22 of his attempts and not missing an extra point this season.</description>
