      <title>Matthew Stafford completed 30-of-47 passes for 389 yards and three touchdowns in the Rams’ 26-23, Week 5 overtime loss to the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a82f-dca3-a9fb-bdbf8f1e0000</link>
      <description>Making his 227th start, Stafford’s 389 yards ended up being the 13th most of his career. The fact that those numbers came in a loss was the result of two back-breaking fumbles by the Rams’ running backs, and Stafford’s own slow start. Inaccurate in the first half, he entered the break with only 109 yards. He obviously made up for it and then some in the final two-plus quarters, but the Rams couldn’t get over the hump vs. a 49ers team starting second and third-stringers at seemingly every other position. Extremely frustrating, though Stafford continues to be largely dazzling after missing the majority of training camp with a back injury. He now gets his first extended break of the season, rejoining the fray in 10 days for a Ravens road trip where he may or may not be trading blows with Lamar Jackson (hamstring).</description>

      <title>Kyren Williams rushed 14 times for 65 yards in the Rams’ 26-23, Week 5 overtime loss to the 49ers, adding eight receptions for 66 yards and two touchdowns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a835-dca3-a9fb-bdbd78e60000</link>
      <description>Fantasy managers aren’t going to see the problem — Williams’ eight receptions and 66 yards receiving were both new career highs — but one of the only reasons the game went to overtime at all was Williams losing a fumble at the 49ers’ three-yard line with 1:07 to go. Had he scored, it would have been 27-23 Rams with the Niners having one minute to score a touchdown with a limping Mac Jones throwing to Kendrick Bourne and DeMarcus Robinson. Williams’ fumble came after an even worse Blake Corum cough up in the first half, as the second-year pro couldn’t handle a simple pitch. (The mistake was somehow credited to Matthew Stafford.) Overtime helped a little bit, but Williams’ 22 touches tied a season high. Corum has become an annoyance, but not enough of one to prevent Williams from maintaining high-end RB2 status for Week 5 against the Ravens’ struggling run defense. Corum, it must be noted, also failed to register a touch after his giveaway.</description>

      <title>Blake Corum notched a 13-yard rush in the Rams’ Week 5 overtime loss to the 49ers, getting held without a catch on two targets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a83e-d95b-addb-e87ed8500000</link>
      <description>Tonight was a “two steps back” performance for Corum after his recent modest step forward, as he muffed a pitch for a “Matthew Stafford” fumble in the second quarter. Although both his targets came after the miscue, Corum never again touched the ball as Kyren Williams piled up 22 touches, including eight receptions. Of course, Williams had a goal-line giveaway of his own in the dying moments of regulation. Perhaps that will help Corum in his recovery from his awful mistake, but we doubt it. Making a move toward RB3 status the past two weeks, Corum will remain a firm RB4 even against the Ravens’ struggling run defense in Week 6.</description>

      <title>Christian McCaffrey rushed 22 times for 57 yards in the 49ers’ Week 5 overtime win over the Rams, adding eight receptions for 82 yards and a touchdown.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a842-dca3-a9fb-bddb83ed0000</link>
      <description>It was yet another underwhelming rushing performance for McCaffrey, who has now been held below 3.0 yards per carry in back-to-back weeks and has posted a mark better than 3.1 only once all season. Then again, he was absolutely dynamite through the air, and now has now caught at least six passes all five times out. CMC has also been efficient as a receiver, posting better than 8.1 yards per reception in each of his five appearances. 8.0 is typically the over/under for a solid running back YPC. For his score this evening, McCaffrey came out of the slot. Although McCaffrey cannot be absolved for his ground struggles, he is getting hit beyhind the line of scrimmage an inordinate amount of times. He will face the Bucs in Week 6.</description>

      <title>Puka Nacua caught 10-of-12 targets for 85 yards and a touchdown in the Rams’ Week 5 overtime loss to the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a846-deb6-a7fd-fbdfb9990000</link>
      <description>The PPR superstar and all-around dynamo has now caught at least 10 passes in 4-of-5 2025 performances. Unbelievable. Nacua is sitting on 52 catches for 588 yards receiving. This evening’s score came on a strange goal line dive play where Matthew Stafford feathered the ball to Nacua on the ground. Nacua has simply been unstoppable while Davante Adams does an admittedly admirable job of occupying defensive attention. Nacua will remain the WR1 overall for Week 6 against the Ravens.</description>

      <title>Kendrick Bourne caught 10-of-11 targets for 142 yards in the 49ers’ Week 5 overtime win over the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a84a-d6e9-af9d-aada777b0000</link>
      <description>30-year-old Patriots castoff Bourne entered this evening with exactly one career 100-yard performance, hitting 100 on the dot in Dec. 2022 for the Pats. He also had only one prior 10-catch outing. His missed connection was a third down drop, but it was an otherwise flawless performance over the middle of the field as Bourne filled in for George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings. The Niners now have 10 days to get (much) healthier for Week 6 against the Bucs, but Bourne could end up maintaining some WR4 fill-in appeal for that one.</description>

      <title>Davante Adams caught 5-of-11 targets for 88 yards in the Rams’ Week 5 overtime loss to the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a84f-d6e9-af9d-aadfbbdd0000</link>
      <description>The catches, yards and targets were all Adams’ second most in five games as a Ram. Solid, though that speaks to what has been a lower floor than fantasy managers have become accustomed to from Adams. For what it’s worth, Adams still seems to be occupying a ton of defensive attention. That doesn’t change the fact that it’s Puka Nacua posting absolutely nuclear box scores. Still doing enough to keep himself in the WR2 ranks, Adams has a plus Week 6 matchup in the Ravens’ injury-ruined defense.</description>

      <title>Tutu Atwell caught 2-of-4 targets for 72 yards in the Rams’ Week 5 overtime loss to the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a852-d6e9-af9d-aad264800000</link>
      <description>Atwell has now cleared 70 yards in back-to-back starts after totaling four in Weeks 1-3. His biggest play was a 38-yard grab in the bonus frame on an absurd deep-crossing shot from Matthew Stafford. Atwell is a valuable real-life role player, but his path to WR4 relevance is blocked by Puka Nacua and Davante Adams’ target dominance.</description>

      <title>Demarcus Robinson caught 3-of-7 targets for 39 yards in the 49ers’ Week 5 overtime win over the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a854-d6e9-af9d-aad4cf590000</link>
      <description>Active for just the second time this season after serving a three-game suspension to begin the year, D-Rob was the fill-in No. 2 wideout behind fill-in No. 1 Kendrick Bourne. With Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings both sidelined, it was Bourne who did the stat-sheet stuffing, turning his 11 targets into 10/142. Jake Tonges also commanded 11 looks at tight end. Coaches love Robinson and his gritty game, but it is not promising he posted this quiet of a box score on an evening where Mac Jones attempted 49 passes. Robinson can be left on waiver wires in all 12-team leagues.</description>

      <title>Jake Tonges caught 7-of-11 targets for 41 yards and a touchdown in the 49ers’ Week 5 overtime win over the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a857-d95b-addb-e857667f0000</link>
      <description>Aside from the yards, it was an evening of new career highs across the board, while the touchdown was Tonges’ third in five 2025 appearances. This, after he entered the season with one career target and zero catches. Tonges has exceeded the wildest expectations for his George Kittle caretaking, but Kittle is eligible to return from his hamstring injury in Week 6, and the early reports are that he just may do so. Tonges’ time in the fantasy TE2 sun could be at an end.</description>
