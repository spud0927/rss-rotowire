      <title>Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Tyreek Hill (oblique) “looks great” for Week 1.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f12b-dbe3-a9bb-f17bba950000</link>
      <description>Hill has missed quite a bit of training camp and, obviously, didn’t play in the preseason. The team has been cautious with him after he suffered an oblique injury and will “do some stuff” today. It sounds like he’ll be on the injury report ahead of Week 1, but that we shouldn’t expect him to have problems playing barring a setback.</description>

      <title>Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Jaylen Wright (leg) had surgery and could be back “Septemberish.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f13a-de13-afdc-f7fbd8450000</link>
      <description>Sounds like Ollie Gordon will get the backup work behind Devon Achane — assuming Achane is able to play in Week 1 — for most of the first month of the season. Jeff Wilson was signed to the practice squad. McDaniel noted that Wright is not out for the season, but given the timeline, it wouldn’t be surprising if Wright was placed on injured reserve before the start of the season.</description>

      <title>Jaguars signed WR Eric Ezukanma to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f13d-de13-afdc-f7ff96050000</link>
      <description>After three years with the Dolphins that yielded just five total games on the active roster, Ezukanma has taken his talents to Atlantic Beach. Joining Ezukanma on Jacksonville’s practice squad are: WR Chandler Brayboy, OL Jerome Carvin, LB Branson Combs, QB Seth Henigan, TE Patrick Herbert, RB Ja’Quinden Jackson, OL Ricky Lee, CB Keni-H Lovely, TE Quintin Morris, DB Jabbar Muhammad, DL Keivie Rose, DB Cam’Ron Silmon-Craig, WR Dorian Singer, OL Sal Wormley and DL Matt Dickerson. It’s a strong collection of names and we definitely didn’t do this blurb just to point out that Keni-H Lovely is a great manga.</description>

      <title>Free agent LB Kyrir White visited the Colts on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f144-de13-afdc-f7cf9b960000</link>
      <description>White, who started all 17 games for the Cardinals last year and finished with 137 combined tackles, is one of the more surprising names still on the free-agent market. With the Colts clearly looking for outside help at linebacker, it makes a lot of sense for them to sniff around the veteran.</description>

      <title>Darnell Mooney (shoulder) is practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f154-de13-afdc-f7dfa1130000</link>
      <description>It’s his first practice since July 24. That’s not a guarantee that he suits up in Week 1 and he’s likely to be on the injury report next week, but it’s certainly optimistic news about his availability going forward.</description>

      <title>Titans CB L’Jarius Sneed (knee) trending toward playing in Week 1 against the the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1a4-d332-a1fd-f7b6d26c0000</link>
      <description>Sneed joined the active roster on August 20th after spending nearly one month on the active/physically unable to perform list, so one would hope he is ready to go by Week 1, given the extended absence. Back in May, Titans head coach Brian Callahan acknowledged that Sneed’s balky knee requires management “all the time,” and the veteran cornerback underwent a cleanup procedure in late July. While the Titans would presumably prefer to feature Sneed as a starter, it’s possible the knee issue limits him to a rotational role.</description>

      <title>Free agent WR Hunter Renfrow “has interest from several teams.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1b8-de13-afdc-f7fb128b0000</link>
      <description>Renfrow is reportedly “weighing his options” at this time. We do not expect Renfrow to land a flex-worthy role, entering his age-30 season. Renfrow was sidelined for the entirety of 2024 due to ulcerative colitis. He could help a young quarterback develop, operating in a rotational backup role, though.</description>

      <title>Saints head coach Kellen Moore said LG Trevor Penning (toe) is out of his walking boot.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1c1-dbe3-a9bb-f1d3b8460000</link>
      <description>Moore reportedly did not “have a substantive update on his progress” beyond that. Penning transitioned from offensive tackle to left guard this offseason, after faring well as a run-blocker but struggling as a pass-protector through three NFL seasons. The lost practice reps could hurt his development. His Week 1 status is unknown.</description>

      <title>Bengals waived DT Eric Gregory.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1c7-d332-a1fd-f7f7502c0000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Ben Baby notes that the Bengals have one practice squad spot remaining. Gregory could be a candidate for it. The Bengals signed OT Javon Foster and S Russ Yeast to the practice squad and released OT Devin Cochran.</description>
