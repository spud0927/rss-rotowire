      <title>Bengals LB Demetrius Knight Jr. left practice early after suffering a “lower extremity injury” on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d361-dbe3-a9bb-f373f2250000</link>
      <description>The Bengals spent a second-round pick on Knight this offseason, and the rookie was penciled in as the team’s co-starter alongside LB Logan Wilson. The Bengals’ defense is already talent-deficient and EDGE Trey Hendrickson’s contract dispute has not yet been resolved. Bengals LB Oren Burks is Knight’s primary competition for the starting role and has had a strong camp. The injury could push the rookie into a backup role to begin the year.</description>

      <title>Patrick Mahomes completed 8-of-13 for 143 yards and one touchdown and rushed once for 18 yards in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d46a-dbe3-a9bb-f47b823e0000</link>
      <description>Mahomes looked good, distributing the ball effectively across his receiving corps. The run game took over on the first drive once the offense entered the red zone, with Kareem Hunt getting the ball on first down before Isiah Pacheco found the end zone from two yards out on second. Mahomes notably targeted rookie RB Brashard Smith twice on the drive. Smith dropped a would-be first-down pass on 2nd-and-10 but Mahomes went back to him three plays later and the two connected for a 12-yard gain. Mahomes then led the offense to a field goal on the second drive by linking up with Tyquan Thornton for 58 yards. He made it a point to get the remaining starters involved on the third drive, which he capped off with a touchdown pass thrown to Rashee Rice.</description>

      <title>Rashee Rice caught 2-of-2 targets for 13 yards and one touchdown in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>

      <description>Rice nearly hauled in a long pass from Patrick Mahomes on the second play from scrimmage but CB Nahshon Wright interfered, resulting in both defensive pass interference and face mask penalties. Rice scored on the Chiefs’ third drive, gaining handsy separation on an end zone fade. He’s a risky pick due to the potential suspension but when on-field, he makes a strong case for WR1 consideration.</description>

      <title>Isiah Pacheco rushed three times for 21 yards and one touchdown in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d47e-db7b-a5dd-f47e0a8e0000</link>
      <description>Pacheco surrendered the Chiefs’ first touch inside the Bears’ five-yard line to Kareem Hunt, but Hunt gained just one yard and Pacheco punched it in on the following play. Pacheco looked like his normal, hard-running, speedy self in this one. Hunt’s red zone involvement is unideal but Pacheco could return RB2 value via his seventh-round ADP.</description>

      <title>Kareem Hunt rushed three times for 15 yards and caught 0-of-1 targets in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d477-dbe3-a9bb-f4779f180000</link>
      <description>Hunt subbed in on the first drive, once the offense got past the Bears’ five-yard line. He immediately got the ball on an inside run but gained just one yard and was yanked in favor of Isiah Pacheco, who promptly scored from two yards out. Securing the scoring position role is likely Hunt’s path to weekly fantasy relevance. He currently profiles as a recommended bench stash with flex-potential.</description>

      <title>Travis Kelce caught 2-of-3 targets for 32 yards in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d483-de13-afdc-d6cb123c0000</link>
      <description>Kelce earned a target on the second drive and recorded his first catch on the third. The veteran tight end remains efficient at age-35, though the Chiefs clearly worked on distributing the ball as much as possible here. Kelce is once again a TE1 entering the season.</description>

      <title>Xavier Worthy caught 1-of-1 targets for nine yards in the Chiefs’ preseason Week 3 game against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d487-de13-afdc-d6cf6c910000</link>
      <description>The Chiefs focused on divvying up looks to all involved early on. Both Worthy and Travis Kelce touched the ball for the first time on the Chiefs’ third drive. Worthy looked like his typically elusive self in this one, and profiles as a high-upside WR3.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d487-de13-afdc-d6cf6c910000</guid>

      <title>Falcons HC Raheem Morris said RT Kaleb McGary (knee) will miss “significant time.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d712-db7b-a5dd-f716aa990000</link>
      <description>Things were trending in this direction when McGary’s injury was first reported, but Morris confirmed everyone’s suspicions after Friday’s preseason game against the Cowboys. The veteran tackle signed a two-year, $30 million extension this offseason, and looks like a near lock to open the season on injured reserve. The Falcons will now look to run out their third-string right tackle as Storm Norton (ankle) is also set to miss multiple weeks.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d712-db7b-a5dd-f716aa990000</guid>

      <title>Jaydon Blue rushed nine times for 25 yards and one touchdown on Friday in the Cowboys’ preseason game against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d746-de13-afdc-d7cfc5e00000</link>
      <description>Blue got involved immediately on special teams, recording a tackle on the opening kickoff. On offense, Blue played all offensive snaps on the second and third drives while Deuce Vaughn played on all snaps for the first and fourth drives. Blue forced three missed tackles on five carries and found the end zone from the Falcons’ one-yard line by fighting his way through contact before bouncing outside. Blue’s workload in the final preseason tune-up isn’t what we typically want to see from a player we hope will make a fantasy impact as a rookie, but this was his first and only preseason game as he dealt with an ankle injury late in camp. While he may not make an impact out of the gate, Blue doesn’t have a high bar to clear to pass Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders on the depth chart. He’s a solid late-round stash in fantasy drafts.</description>

      <title>Brashard Smith rushed two times for one yard in the Chiefs’ preseason finale against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d751-d332-a1fd-d777af3b0000</link>
      <description>Smith didn’t provide much production on the field, totaling just 13 yards from scrimmage on three touches, but the rookie worked early with the first-team offense and saw three targets in his limited outing. He dropped a critical pass that would have converted a first-down, but his early usage was encouraging. For now, Smith still appears buried on the depth chart behind Isiah Pacheco, Kareem Hunt, and Elijah Mitchell, but it’s easy to envision him securing a meaningful role at some point in the season, given his competition.</description>
