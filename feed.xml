      <title>Dalton Kincaid (hamstring/knee) is active for Week 14 vs Bengals</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f9c2-d77b-adfa-fbc39e2d0000</link>
      <description>Kincaid will be active for the first time since Week 10. The Bills can certainly use him with Josh Palmer (ankle) out, and their WR corps lacking consistent producers. Kincaid was the Bills’ most reliable receiving option prior to injury, and with snow falling in this one, he could be heavily targeted over the middle of the field. For what it’s worth, Bills beat writer Joe Buscaglia predicted that Kincaid would play under 50% of the snaps today but would be on the field in most passing situations. Kincaid is probably somebody you want to start unless you have a locked in top five TE option.</description>

      <title>Bills declared WR Joshua Palmer, OT Spencer Brown. OT Chase Lundt, DE Joey Bosa, DT Phidarian Mathis, LB Terrel Bernard, and S Darnell Savage inactive for Week 14 vs Bengals.</title>

      <description>The Bills’ offensive line held up well last weekend, even with Brown and left tackle Dion Dawkins (concussion) out. Dawkins is back for this one, but the Bills will still be down their starting right tackle in a snow game, where they could rely on James Cook and the rushing attack a lot. Joey Bosa continues to be week-to-week, but his loss is a big one for this pass rush, and Shaq Thompson will start again with Terrel Bernard out.</description>

      <title>Bengals declared QB Jake Browning, WR Jermaine Burton, DE Trey Hendrickson, TE Cam Grandy and DT Jordan Jefferson inactive for Week 14 vs Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f9c9-d77b-adfa-fbcb73da0000</link>
      <description>No surprises here. Burton was suspended earlier this morning, and Hendrickson was ruled out earlier in the week with a hip injury. Browning is the emergency third quarterback.</description>

      <title>Jets QB Tyrod Taylor (groin) is questionable to return in Week 14 against the Dolphins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-fa11-d77b-adfa-fa933d0d0000</link>
      <description>Taylor left in the first quarter against the Dolphins with an apparent groin injury. He headed to the locker room after throwing an interception; with Justin Fields (knee) inactive for this game, former Missouri Tiger Brady Cook is making his NFL debut at quarterback. Taylor is questionable to return.</description>

      <title>Colts QB Daniel Jones (Achilles) left Indianapolis’ Week 14 game against the Jaguars and will not return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-fa23-d77b-adfa-faa394830000</link>
      <description>He immediately reached for the Achilles on the dropback near the end of the first quarter, it was non-contact. Jones slammed his helmet on the turf multiple times before gingerly limping off with trainers and heading to the blue tent. He then followed them to the locker room. Jones had been 5-of-7 for 60 yards and an interception in the early going, but that is not the main concern for the Colts now. Riley Leonard took over at quarterback.</description>

      <title>Dolphins RB De’Von Achane (rib) is questionable to return Week 14 against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-fa3f-d8cf-affb-fe3f53930000</link>
      <description>Fantasy managers get a major scare ahead of the fantasy playoffs as Achane got up gingerly after getting tackled at the end of a 29-yard rush in the second quarter. He went to the medical tent in pain and walked to the locker room prior to halftime. Achane is questionable to return with a rib injury; Jaylen Wright is getting the majority of backfield touches while he is out against the Jets.</description>

      <title>Steelers TE Darnell Washington (concussion) was ruled out in Week 14 against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-fa35-d8cf-affb-fe3f15d90000</link>
      <description>Washington’s head hit the ground hard at the end of a catch and run in the first quarter against Baltimore. He was woozy and helped to the locker room, where he was evaluated for a brain injury and quickly ruled out. Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth will likely see more snaps and pass routes with Washington sidelined, though neither player will be reliable in fantasy.</description>

      <title>Broncos declared DT D.J. Jones, TE Nate Adkins, OLB Que Robinson, CB Reese Taylor, DL Jordan Jackson and OT Geron Christian inactive for Week 14 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f194-d8cf-affb-fdbefdbb0000</link>
      <description>Jones’ absence is due to an ankle injury, leaving the Broncos’ defense without its starting nose tackle. Fortunately, DL Zach Allen (calf) is active, as is WR Pat Bryant (hamstring). Allen has tallied 48 quarterback pressures and eight sacks so far this season. He has strong odds of increasing both sums against Raiders QB Geno Smith (foot), who enters Week 14 with the second-highest sack sum (46) this year.</description>

      <title>Jayden Daniels was seen entering the medical tent in Week 14’s game against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f9ac-d005-a9bf-f9bc52180000</link>
      <description>Daniels had a batted pass intercepted in the opening drive of the third quarter and was lit up on a block by cornerback Isaiah Rodgers on the return. Daniels was in visible pain and appeared to be grabbing at his elbow/shoulder — the same one he injured in Week 9 against the Seahawks. After sitting on the sideline for a bit, Daniels was seen heading to the medical tent. He is now considered questionable to return.</description>

      <title>Raiders declared TE Michael Mayer, WR Dont’e Thornton, RB Zamir White, QB Aidan O’Connell, CB Darnay Holmes, WR Alex Bachman and DT Leki Fotu inactive for Week 14 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-fa59-d77b-adfa-fadba8640000</link>
      <description>Mayer has been sidelined since injuring his ankle in Week 12 against the Browns. Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said he expects rookie WR Jack Bech to be more involved with Thornton, a fellow rookie, sidelined this week. Thornton has caught just 8-of-25 targets for 123 yards this season, though, so his absence in the passing game is hardly significant. Bech should not be started against the Broncos’ elite defense.</description>
