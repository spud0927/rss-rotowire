      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Steelers WR DK Metcalf’s two-game suspension was upheld upon appeal.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4dcb-dc7a-af9b-cfff362d0000</link>
      <description>Metcalf was suspended by the NFL for the final two games of the regular season after an altercation with a fan in the Steelers’ Week 16 win over the Lions. He appealed the ruling, having previously reported the fan to Seahawks team security prior to his trade to the Steelers. An appeals officer jointly appointed by the NFL and NFLPA upheld Metcalf’s suspension and he will now miss Weeks 17 and 18 against the Browns and Ravens. It is costly in two ways for Metcalf; he will lose $555K in salary and has $45 million guaranteed voided, while the Steelers will not have him for a stretch run in which a win clinches the AFC North for them. Roman Wilson is in line for increased opportunities with Metcalf out, though we do not recommend him for fantasy lineups in the fantasy championship.</description>

      <title>Hearing officer Jordy Nelson, jointly appointed by the NFL and NFLPA, upheld Chargers LB Denzel Perryman’s two-game suspension.</title>

      <description>Perryman was suspended for repeated violations of the playing rules intended to protect the health and safety of players. The NFL dealt out his punishment given Perryman’s history of suspension due to rule safety violations, with a previous two-game suspension coming in 2023 for the same reason. The NFL has made it clear they will not tolerate repeated risky hits from players. Perryman will miss the final two games of the regular season.</description>

      <title>Malik Willis (shoulder) said he believes he’ll be ready for Week 17 against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-507a-dc7a-af9b-dfff65060000</link>
      <description>“I try to take it one day at a time, but I would assume that I’m going to be ready,” Willis said Tuesday. Willis sustained a shoulder injury late in the Packers’ Week 16 loss to the Bears. He was estimated to have a limited practice on Tuesday and would seem likely to suit up against Baltimore on Thursday. Jordan Love was also listed as a limited practice participant on Tuesday with a shoulder injury and a concussion he suffered in Week 16. If Love is sidelined, Willis becomes an interesting superflex play thanks to his rushing upside.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee) is expected to play in Week 17 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-50ca-d968-a19b-58fb68a60000</link>
      <description>Lions head coach Dan Campbell described St. Brown’s injury as “a little irritation” that should not sideline him for Christmas Day against the Vikings. St. Brown, who plays through all manner of injuries — including a high ankle sprain a few weeks ago — should be a full go against Minnesota. He had nine catches for 97 yards on 13 targets the last time the Lions played the Vikings.</description>

      <title>Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio reports the NFL is still investigating the fan involved in Week 16’s DK Metcalf incident.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-50df-d35e-a1bf-55df66020000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said on Tuesday that the league “and the Lions will not take action against the fan involved in the altercation with Steelers WR DK Metcalf on Sunday in Detroit because ‘there was no violation of the fan code of conduct,’ per source.” Metcalf was seen throwing a punch at the fan, Ryan Kennedy, after the two exchanged words during the Steelers’ Week 16 game against the Lions. The league refuted the report from its employee, Rapoport. “The report about the fan and discipline was not accurate,” and NFL spokesperson told Pro Football Talk. “The matter remains under review and the league is following up with the club.” Metcalf alleged Kennedy used a racial slur and insulted his mother before the skirmish took place. Kennedy denies this.</description>

      <title>The Mercury News’ Jerry McDonald reports 49ers TE Jake Tonges will see an increase in playing time if George Kittle (ankle) is out in Week 17.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-510c-d968-a19b-59fd49f60000</link>
      <description>Tonges operated as the Niners’ primary pass-catching tight end earlier this season when Kittle was sidelined with an injury, and could find himself in that role again this week against the Bears if Kittle — who sustained a “low to mid” ankle sprain on Monday night — is sidelined. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said he’s confident Tonges can take on the role and be a productive part of the team’s red-hot passing offense. Tonges had 22 receptions over five games with Kittle out in the first half of the season. He would be a viable 14-team league option against the Bears if Kittle can’t suit up.</description>

      <title>Colts head coach Shane Steichen said Anthony Richardson (eye) won’t be activated from IR for Week 17.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-511e-d35e-a1bf-55dee7d70000</link>
      <description>Richardson will remained sidelined with an eye injury he suffered in October in a freak pre-game warmup accident. Richardson was seen on the Colts sideline on Monday night against the 49ers wearing dark sunglasses. It’s possible he’s played his final snap with the Colts after a disastrous three-year run in which he had 11 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions over 17 regular season games. He could be a backup or third stringer for another team in 2026 if anyone is willing to take a chance on the 23-year-old QB.</description>

      <title>Raiders placed Brock Bowers (knee) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5130-d35e-a1bf-55f2a8d10000</link>
      <description>It comes out of nowhere but makes sense considering Bowers has dealt with a knee injury all season and the Raiders were long ago eliminated from postseason contention. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero said “the decision was made to get it taken care of now and focus on being 100% in 2026.” That could mean Bowers will undergo surgery in the offseason after playing through the knee ailment for four months. Bowers ends 2025 with 64 receptions for 680 yards and seven touchdowns on 84 targets over 12 games. All of his metrics remained similar to his outstanding rookie campaign in 2024. He’ll be an elite fantasy producer in 2026, hopefully with a different quarterback and coaching staff.</description>

      <title>Jordan Love (concussion) practiced Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5149-d35e-a1bf-55cb6e440000</link>
      <description>Love remains in the NFL’s concussion protocol, however. He suffered the head injury last week against the Bears and did not return to the game. If he’s able to clear the protocol today, he could suit up on Thursday against the Ravens. Malik Willis, who is struggling with a shoulder injury he picked up against the Bears, would presumably get the starting nod if Love is out for Week 17. Willis said he believes he can play through the injury. He would make for an interesting superflex option if he starts against Baltimore.</description>
