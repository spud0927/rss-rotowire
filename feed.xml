      <title>Travis Etienne Jr. rushed three times for 24 yards and caught 1-of-1 targets for eight yards in the Jaguars’ preseason Week 2 game against the Saints.</title>

      <description>Etienne subbed in for both third downs on the Jaguars’ first offensive drive. He then played 6-of-8 snaps on the second drive before being done for the day. Etienne and Tank Bigsby will seemingly duke it out for the starting job next week, though Bhayshul Tuten continues to play well behind them.</description>

      <title>Bhayshul Tuten rushed 10 times for 35 yards and one touchdown and caught 1-of-1 targets for six yards in the Jaguars’ preseason Week 2 game against the Saints.</title>

      <description>Tuten continues to look good, playing with the second team. Though he stands just 5'9/209, Tuten’s ability to fight through contact and move the pile on inside runs really jumps off the screen. He scored his second preseason touchdown on a three-yard run up the middle against the Saints, muscling past DB Jordan Howden, who attempted to go low on the spry rookie rusher. He should continue to be drafted as a high-upside bench stash.</description>

      <title>Brian Thomas Jr. caught 2-of-4 targets for eight yards and rushed once for two yards in the Jaguars’ preseason Week 2 game against the Saints.</title>

      <description>Thomas’ creative preseason usage continued in this one.He took 6-of-16 snaps lined up in the slot, with one such play resulting in a sneaky handoff. The talented, young receiver is a WR1 entering year two as a pro.</description>

      <title>Jordan Schultz reports that the Commanders “have been shopping RB Brian Robinson Jr. to teams around the NFL.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba20-df63-a199-fb2b212e0000</link>
      <description>Robinson averaged fewer than 4.0 yards per carry in five of his final seven games last year, and the Commanders are said to be focused on creating more explosive plays this season. Enter Day 3 rookie RB Jacory Croskey-Merritt, who has steadily earned the coaching staff’s praise through spring and summer practices. The team also has RB Chris Rodriguez Jr. under contract this year, who boasts a career 4.9 YPC average through two seasons operating as a rotational rusher. Robinson is scheduled to enter free agency at the end of the year. If the front office feels good about Croskey-Merritt and Rodriguez, it makes sense for them to send Robinson away in exchange for future draft capital or a young player at a position of need.</description>

      <title>Chris Olave caught 2-of-4 targets for 12 yards in the Saints’ preseason Week 2 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba2f-d90d-a5bd-ba7f49460000</link>
      <description>Olave was on the field for 18-of-18 first-team snaps with Tyler Shough, which is a great sign for his ankle health. His concussion history, coupled with the Saints’ questionable quarterback situation, enhances his risk, but fantasy managers are advised to continue drafting Olave as a high-upside seventh-round pick.</description>

      <title>Rashid Shaheed caught 3-of-3 targets for 15 yards in the Saints’ preseason Week 2 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba50-df63-a199-fb7bf0ac0000</link>
      <description>Shaheed played all 18 first-team reps alongside Tyler Shough and Chris Olave. He kicked inside, tying for a first-team-high seven snaps lined up in the slot. Adding quick-hitting layup routes from the slot will go a long way toward stabilizing Shaheed’s weekly scoring. His 13th-round PPR ADP makes for an easy click.</description>

      <title>Spencer Rattler completed 18-of-24 passes for 199 yards, one touchdown and one interception and rushed three times for 19 yards and one two-point conversion in the Saints’ preseason Week 2 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba67-d05a-adda-bae798c80000</link>
      <description>Rattler looked better than Tyler Shough did, though Rattler had the benefit of facing backups. The Saints are in an unenviable situation. Their rookie quarterback is failing to outplay their preferred backup. Fortunately, fantasy managers need not draft either player in re-draft formats.</description>

      <title>Kendre Miller rushed six times for 21 yards in the Saints’ preseason Week 2 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba67-d05a-adda-bae75efa0000</link>
      <description>Miller played 5-of-5 snaps on the first drive, critically remaining on-field for third down. Ultimately, he and Cam Akers split first-team snaps 14-to-7, with Akers playing the remaining four third downs. Miller is astonishingly credited with five missed tackles forced. Akers rushed twice for two yards and caught 3-of-3 targets for 11 yards.</description>

      <title>Caleb Williams completed 6-of-10 passes for 107 yards and one touchdown in the Bears’ preseason Week 2 game against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-baab-d45c-a7fc-babb3aab0000</link>
      <description>Williams stood tall in the pocket and efficiently distributed the ball across his pass-catching corps. The Bills’ defense was mostly comprised of backups and rotational players, but it was a promising showing for a Bears offense that has received up-and-down reviews thus far.</description>
