      <title>Miles Sanders rushed seven times for 15 yards Saturday in the Cowboys’ preseason game against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b573-df63-a199-fd7bc5140000</link>
      <description>Just days after it was reported the Cowboys had no clear leader for their RB1 role, it’s safe to assume Sanders didn’t do anything to separate himself from the pack. The veteran running back drew the start in Saturday’s contest, playing 11 snaps while handling seven carries. His longest rush came on a seven-yard gain. Rookie Jaydon Blue (ankle) wasn’t active for this one, and Javonte Williams, who is healthy, was held out. We can’t say for certain that this is the worst backfield in football, but there’s little reason to believe a bona fide stud emerges from this group.</description>

      <title>Jaxson Dart completed 14-of-16 passes for one touchdown in the Giants’ preseason game against the Jets, adding two carries for five additional yards and one touchdown.</title>

      <description>The Giants’ rookie signal-caller continues to impress, and played on another level on Saturday night. While his 87.5 completion percent is impressive on its own, we can’t overlook the fact that Dart completed the final 13 passes he attempted on the day, and capped his final drive with a one-yard score on a QB sneak. Dart was in control throughout the afternoon and slung a nicely thrown ball to Greg Dulcich for a 20-yard score on the opening drive of the third quarter. Despite two solid preseason performances, Dart isn’t expected to unseat Russell Wilson before Week 1’s game against the Commanders, but it’s safe to assume he’s rapidly bridging the gap and could soon find himself earning first-team reps in practice.</description>

      <title>Joe Milton completed 9-of-18 passes for 122 yards, one touchdown, and one interception in the Cowboys’ preseason game against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b593-d90d-a5bd-b7db95a00000</link>
      <description>At one point, Milton was 3-of-10 passing. The second-year quarterback who took a sack for a safety on his team’s opening drive looked as erratic as we’ve seen during his time as a pro, and ended the day with an absurd 15.2 ADOT. Milton missed his intended target all night, with PFF attributing just one of his incompletions to a dropped pass. His best play on the night came on a 49-yard completion to Jonathan Mingo, but it’s hard to ignore what we’ve witnessed from Milton through two preseason games. He’s completed 26-of-47 passes (55.3 percent) for one touchdown and two interceptions, and has taken three sacks on 10 pressures. Thankfully for the Cowboys, Dak Prescott is healthy, but it may be time for the Cowboys to explore additional depth behind their QB1 after Milton appears to have reverted to the player we saw for parts of six college seasons.</description>

      <title>Sixth-round rookie Tyler Loop has been named the Ravens’ starting kicker.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b5f2-d05a-adda-bff2f1a50000</link>
      <description>“He’ll be the kicker,” coach John Harbaugh confirmed after Saturday’s preseason game. “He’s earned it.” Loop was always the favorite to replace Justin Tucker by virtue of having draft capital. Despite his rookie status and strong if not impeccable college pedigree, Loop is immediately fantasy relevant as the kicker for one of the league’s highest-scoring offenses.</description>

      <title>Ravens coach John Harbaugh revealed Keaton Mitchell’s injury is to his hamstring, but that he could return this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b5f5-d45c-a7fc-b7ffcdef0000</link>
      <description>It’s not a major concern, but the 23-year-old has now been sidelined over a week as he tries to challenge Justice Hill for change-of-pace work behind Derrick Henry. It all but guarantees he will begin the season as a somewhat distant No. 3 back, keeping him off the radar in most 12-team leagues.</description>

      <title>Giants HC Brian Daboll said “Russ (Wilson) is our starter” following the team’s preseason win over the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b82d-df63-a199-f92f4e990000</link>
      <description>We’ve finally reached the point where Daboll will be asked on a near-weekly basis who his starting quarterback is until the team inevitably inserts Jaxson Dart as QB1. The question isn’t unwarranted after Dart completed 14-of-16 passes for 137 yards and a touchdown against the Jets on Saturday night, but Wilson was always expected to open the season as the starter, and as of now, those plans haven’t changed. That said, the precision and command Dart showed on Saturday was impressive, and may lead to a changing of the guard that’s a bit sooner than expected. We should still expect Wilson under center in Week 1 when the Giants take on the Commanders.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Rich Cimini believes “it’s clear from practice and game usage that second-year wide receiver Malachi Corley is on the roster bubble.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b839-d05a-adda-babb99100000</link>
      <description>During the 2024 NFL Draft, the Jets, under former head coach Robert Saleh and former GM Joe Douglas, traded two draft picks to move up and select Corley with the No. 65 overall pick. It’s been a disaster for Corley ever since, as the former Western Kentucky Hilltopper quickly fell out of favor with the old regime and caught just three passes for 16 yards across nine games. In Saturday’s preseason outing against the Giants, Corley played on 14 offensive snaps with the backups and failed to draw a target. He caught one pass for eight yards in the team’s first preseason game. Corely is a skilled player who drew comps to Deebo Samuel during the predraft process. If he doesn’t make the initial 53-man roster on cutdown day, there could be plenty of teams willing to take him on as a reclamation project.</description>

      <title>Giants HC Brian Daboll said Andrew Thomas (foot) is taking his recovery day by day and “getting better.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b859-df63-a199-f97b12f10000</link>
      <description>Giants GM Joe Schoen said in July that Thomas should be good to go for Week 1 against the Commanders, but the team is in no rush to predict a return. Speaking on Sunday, Daboll said the decision to activate Thomas would be based on what Thomas and the team consider to be best. It’s about as predictable a response as we could expect. Thomas is rehabbing from a foot injury that ended his season in October and opened camp on the PUP list. If he is activated before camp ends, he would have roughly three weeks to be ready for Week 1.</description>

      <title>Cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot reports Shedeur Sanders (oblique) ‘tossed some short passes to tight end David Njoku in pregame warmups.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b89f-df63-a199-f9bf22d30000</link>
      <description>According to Cabot, Sanders’ throwing session has raised hopes that he will be able to get on the field in the Browns’ preseason finale against the Rams next week. The rookie missed Saturday’s game against the Eagles due to an oblique injury he suffered late in the week, but there’s hope that with enough time to recover, he should be ready for next Saturday’s game. Sanders could be one of several Browns quarterbacks to see action next week, as head coach Kevin Stefanski said he hopes to have all four quarterbacks healthy. It seems unlikely that Joe Flacco would suit up, but Sanders, along with Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, could all see ample reps as they look to solidify their spots on the depth chart.</description>

      <title>Jaguars WR/CB Travis Hunter (upper body) will not play in Sunday’s preseason game against the Saints.</title>

      <description>Hunter is dealing with a non-specified upper body injury that was reported on Friday. Head coach Liam Coen hinted that Hunter might miss Sunday’s game due to the injury, but this appears to be a minor issue that shouldn’t carry over into Week 1.</description>
