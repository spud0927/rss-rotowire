      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler believes the Cardinals and Dolphins are “teams [he’ll] be watching” to pursue impending free agent Malik Willis.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3ddf-d89c-a1be-bfdfc8600000</link>
      <description>The entire Dolphins front office is now essentially a Packers front office after they hired GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and head coach Jeff Hafley away, so that’s an easy tie. Mike LaFleur, the new head coach in Arizona, can pick the brain of his brother (Green Bay’s head coach) about Willis. We’ve tied Willis to the Dolphins earlier this offseason, but it’s a little surprising to see the Cardinals as a potential suitor given how well Jacoby Brissett played down the stretch in 2025.</description>

      <title>Falcons fired VP of football operations Ryan Pace.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3de5-d042-afbc-7df79cd20000</link>
      <description>Pace will “have options elsewhere” per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero. The former Bears general manager will look to rebuild the reputation in a new front office in 2026. The Falcons signaled what they thought of the current brain trust when they cleaned house after the season, and ‘president of football’ Matt Ryan clearly had no use for Pace.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo believes Landon Dickerson is “no certainty to return” to the Eagles in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3dea-d629-a1bc-bdffb85b0000</link>
      <description>Dickerson is just 27, but struggled through a challenging season in 2025 with two missed games while struggling through several games with ankle and quad injuries. He didn’t look right from the jump. Lane Johnson is another retirement possibility for the Eagles, and The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McLane believes Johnson isn’t sure his body will hold up and he’s “not sure if he’s coming back or not.” The Eagles are set up for plenty of turnover on the offensive side of the ball this offseason and likely will need to target picks on the offensive line even if Dickerson and Johnson return.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports the Bengals won’t entertain trade offers for QB Joe Burrow.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3dfd-d042-afbc-7dff77bb0000</link>
      <description>“I do expect teams to call the Cincinnati Bengals,” Rapoport said. There was a brief groundswell of the idea of a Burrow trade towards the end of the season when he let loose on how bad he was feeling at a press conference, but even if he had wanted out, the Bengals have always played hardball with their players that they want to keep. The Bengals, per Rapoport, will instead channel Burrow’s belief that things need to change into spending and getting better on defense. We’ll believe that when we see it.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reports the Eagles have not had trade talks with other teams yet about A.J. Brown.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3e04-d89c-a1be-bfdf815f0000</link>
      <description>They also, per Garafolo, have only briefly broached with Brown’s “camp” the idea of a trade. Talks are expected to pick up near the scouting combine. Brown told Garafolo that “a lot of this is out of my control at this point.” We’re not entirely sure what to make of that, but the best guess probably remains that there will be trade talks with Brown at some point. It might come down to what kind of price the Eagles have set on the star wideout and how close other teams are willing to get to it. There’s certainly no way Howie Roseman is letting Brown walk without getting a first-round pick.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Kevin Seifert reports “many league sources” think the Vikings will pursue Broncos GM George Paton for their general manager vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3e09-d355-a5bd-bf5dbc810000</link>
      <description>Paton would presumably require compensation to acquire. And while he has done an admirable job rebounding from it over the past few years with Sean Payton, our first taste of Paton is always going to be the disastrous Russell Wilson trade. However, as the long-time lieutenant to Rick Spielman in Minnesota, it is not surprising that the Vikings would have some interest in bringing Paton back. This will probably be one to watch after the draft.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Kevin Seifert reports “all bets are off” on the Vikings plans for J.J. McCarthy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3e10-d89c-a1be-bfdff5b90000</link>
      <description>“If anything, [firing Adofo-Mensah] increase the chances that the Vikings will take a big swing at finding a veteran quarterback who could start in 2026,” Seifert writes. With the GM who believed in him gone, it’s likely that McCarthy will enter training camp in a competition for his job in the best-case scenario. His dynasty stock has gone full Anthony Richardson over the last year and he should not be treated as a sure-fire starter in best ball drafts this offseason.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler believes Seahawks quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko is a “natural candidate” to be the Raiders offensive coordinator under Klint Kubiak.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3e14-d89c-a1be-bfdf2ff50000</link>
      <description>Janocko has followed Kubiak as he’s had stints in Minnesota, New Orleans, and now Seattle. Fowler also notes that Seahawks passing game coordinator Jake Peetz could get an in-house look as Seattle’s offensive coordinator when Kubiak leaving is officially finalized.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports “several people in the league” think Broncos coach Sean Payton will eventually relinquish playcalling to OC Davis Webb.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3e1f-d355-a5bd-bf5f8ee20000</link>
      <description>We’ll believe it when we see it, of course, but it could be a way for the Broncos to continue to hold on to Webb while paying him as if he were a head coach. We have no mathematical data for how a Webb offense would run differently than a Payton one, and would likely be relying on quotes and beat-writer reports until we saw how it would play out on the field. It was already clear the Broncos really didn’t want Webb to get away, but giving him playcalling duties would be another level of dedication to that idea.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes the Cowboys could trade George Pickens this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3e24-d042-afbc-7ff63df60000</link>
      <description>“A tag-and-trade scenario is considered to be a possibility for Dallas” this offseason, Rapoport reports. It makes all the sense in the world for Dallas given how they rehabilitated Pickens’ value this offseason and how the current state of their salary cap is. It would be much easier to do the work on the defensive side of the ball with extra money from not keeping Pickens. Of course, that relies on the Cowboys to be excited about a young receiver in the draft, or perhaps with elevating Ryan Flournoy to a bigger role. We wouldn’t count on this to happen, but a Pickens tag-and-trade definitely is a plausible scenario for how this unfolds.</description>
