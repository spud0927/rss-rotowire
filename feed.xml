      <title>Bills head coach Joe Brady said WR Keon Coleman “is not done being a Buffalo Bill.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b5c-d355-a5bd-8f5c1c850000</link>
      <description>Last week, Bills owner Terry Pegula blamed former head coach Sean McDermott for the second-round pick spent on Coleman in 2024, absolving general manager Brandon Beane along the way. Brady said that he spoke with Coleman after being named the Bills’ new head coach, telling the young wide receiver that he fully supports him. Day 2 picks are rarely traded or released just two years into their career, but Brady’s comments help clarify Coleman’s status on the roster following Pegula’s strong remarks.</description>

      <title>Panthers RB Jonathon Brooks said he was “hopeful” to attend minicamp but “there is no set date” on his full return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b52-d355-a5bd-8f569ac10000</link>
      <description>Brooks missed the entire 2025 season after tearing his ACL for the second time in 2024. He’s still entering his age-23 season and the third year of his rookie contract, so we can’t rule out that he’ll see a real role with the Panthers in 2026. How the Panthers treat Rico Dowdle (or a replacement for Dowdle) in free agency will likely tell us a lot about how they view Brooks’ recovery, but Panthers GM Dan Morgan did praise how he was attacking his rehab and said he’s “looking great.”</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Josh Kendall believes Bijan Robinson’s heavy workload will continue “and perhaps even increase” under new head coach Kevin Stefanski.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b72-dfd7-a5dc-0f73a1ac0000</link>
      <description>The Falcons gave Robinson 366 touches in 2025, third in the league behind Jonathan Taylor (369) and Christian McCaffrey’s league-leading 413. Tyler Allgeier is a free agent and Stefanski’s teams have heavily emphasized the run. While we’re not saying that Robinson is a sure bet for an increase — it’s hard to call any player with 366 touches as “due” for more work — it does appear to at least be on the table. That would only strengthen his case to go 1.1 in most standard drafts in 2026.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Josh Kendall and Jeff Howe report Kirk Cousins is expected to be released.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b77-d042-afbc-7ff717710000</link>
      <description>The way the Falcons re-structured Cousins’ contract earlier in the offseason pointed to this, but Kendall also reports that Cousins could be brought back by the Falcons on a less-expensive contract. Cousins will likely have his share of suitors in the offseason despite entering his age-38 season, so it’s no lock he’d be back in Atlanta if released. Kevin Stefanski notably didn’t say much when asked about Cousins at his opening press conference earlier in the week.</description>

      <title>Falcons completed an interview with Bears assistant general manager Ian Cunningham for their general manager vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b76-d355-a5bd-8f76f95e0000</link>
      <description>Cunningham previously interviewed for the Falcons’ president of football position, and has now completed two interviews for their general manager vacancy. Reports continue to list him as a favorite for this role. Texans assistant GM James Liipfert is also considered a finalist for the position.</description>

      <title>Giants requested an interview with Colts pass-game coordinator Alex Tanney for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b7b-d355-a5bd-8f7fb48b0000</link>
      <description>The long-time journeyman quarterback had worked as Eagles quarterbacks coach before packing up to Indianapolis with Shane Steichen. It’s his first offensive coordinator interview. Tanney is most famous for posting several trick-shot videos on YouTube in the early 2010s. He attempted just 15 professional passes from 2012-2020, spending the 2018-2020 seasons with the Giants.</description>

      <title>Bills hired Pat Meyer as their new offensive line coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b82-d355-a5bd-8fd6d20e0000</link>
      <description>Meyer served as the Panthers’ offensive line coach from 2020-2021, while new Bills head coach Joe Brady served as the Panthers’ offensive coordinator. Meyer spent the following five seasons serving in the same role with the Steelers.</description>

      <title>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer reports the Cardinals and Raiders are “both waiting to talk” to Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak before making a final decision on their head-coaching vacancies.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b97-d355-a5bd-8fd7741a0000</link>
      <description>Both teams are scheduled to have an in-person interview with Kubiak on Saturday per Breer. The Raiders have been positioned as the “prime candidate” and Kubiak’s “job to lose” in recent days, but it might come down to which team he feels more comfortable with. These are two of the weakest organizations in the NFL over the past three seasons. Kubiak may ultimately be choosing between Fernando Mendoza and the vacuum that the Cardinals have at quarterback with Kyler Murray expected to be traded.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Todd Archer believes Cowboys RB Jaydon Blue “comes into camp as the No. 3 back at best.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b9f-d355-a5bd-8fdfdceb0000</link>
      <description>“Even if [Javonte] Williams does not re-sign, the Cowboys will look to find a lead back in free agency,” Archer adds. Blue had a nice meaningless Week 18 game where he almost doubled his carry total for the season and scored, but we agree with Archer that it’s hard to view him as a potential 2026 lead back for the Cowboys at this point. Blue’s dynasty stock is well down from its 2025 preseason peak.</description>

      <title>LSU OC Charlie Weis Jr. “keeps coming up in league circles” regarding the Giants’ offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0bbd-dead-af9e-6fbfe4120000</link>
      <description>SNY TV’s Connor Hughes notes that Weis arrived at Ole Miss the same year as Giants QB Jaxson Dart (2022), serving as his quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator all three years. The two reportedly remain close. Reuniting them makes sense.</description>
