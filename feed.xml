      <title>J.J. McCarthy completed 11-of-21 passes for 158 yards and two interceptions in the Vikings’ 22-6, Week 2 loss to the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b7e-d294-a19b-effeaee80000</link>
      <description>McCarthy and the Vikings were unable to replicate their fourth quarter magic from Week 1 after struggling to move the football for three quarters, managing just six points before the break and being held off the scoreboard entirely in the final two frames. The second-year effective rookie also put the ball on the ground three times, losing one fumble, as the Vikings gained just 198 total yards of offense on a modest 23:28 time of possession. The early-season returns are less than adequate to sustain viable fantasy production for managers that invested in Kevin O’Connell’s offense, something the team will look to correct ahead of a Week 3 meeting with a Bengals team without quarterback Joe Burrow.</description>

      <title>Jordan Mason rushed nine times for 33 yards in the Vikings’ Week 2 loss to the Falcons, adding eight yards on two receptions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b84-d86f-abdd-4fbd5ca60000</link>
      <description>The Vikings were held to just 46 offensive plays in a game the Falcons controlled throughout via an imposing run game, yielding just 12 opportunities for Mason. His 3.3 yards per carry were indicative of the team’s struggles to move the football as their offensive line clearly showed the wear of missing two starters. Fellow running back Aaron Jones departed in the second half with a hamstring injury, something that could propel Mason to a featured role ahead of a Week 3 meeting with the Bengals.</description>

      <title>Justin Jefferson caught 3-of-6 targets for 81 yards in the Vikings’ Week 2 loss to the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b87-d294-a19b-eff7a2390000</link>
      <description>Quarterback J.J. McCarthy attempted just 21 passes on a night the Vikings managed just 46 offensive plays, yielding just six targets for Jefferson in the process. Things looked to be turning around late in the first half when McCarthy connected with Jefferson on a 50-yard catch-and-run in the middle of the field to set up a field goal as time expired, but the two could not rekindle their late-game magic from Week 1. The salt in the wound came late in the fourth quarter when McCarthy badly overthrew Jefferson for a pick, allowing the Falcons to effectively run out the clock to end the game. Jefferson is likely to return better production when the Vikings host the Bengals in Week 3.</description>

      <title>T.J. Hockenson caught 1-of-3 targets for 12 yards in the Vikings’ Week 2 loss to the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b8b-dc44-a9d9-4fefdb100000</link>
      <description>Hockenson’s receiving line tells the tale of the Vikings’ game, one in which they managed just 46 offensive plays while getting completely manhandled in the trenches on both sides of the ball. What’s worse, the Vikings only trailed 9-6 at the half and had every opportunity for a curtain-call performance in the final quarter, but the team could not rekindle the late-game magic from Week 1 and fell to a 1-1 record in the process. Hockenson has now gone two games with no more than 15 yards, something fantasy manager hope is rectified in short order considering he went off the board as the fantasy TE4 in drafts this summer. Maybe a matchup against the tight end-funnel Bengals will kick start his season in Week 3.</description>

      <title>Jalen Nailor caught 1-of-3 targets 28 yards in the Vikings’ Week 2 loss to the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b8f-dc44-a9d9-4fefebf10000</link>
      <description>Nailor remains buried behind Justin Jefferson, T.J. Hockenson, and the backfield in the target pecking order for the Vikings, leaving little room for weekly fantasy value. He should remain on the waiver wire, until further notice.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Joe Burrow “will need surgery that will sideline him a minimum of three months.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4d62-da67-a99f-cdf743410000</link>
      <description>The most talked-about toe in America will officially sideline Burrow for the next three months, and maybe longer. Things felt like they were trending in this direction after reports surfaced late in the night that surgery could be on the table after we learned the Bengals sent images to foot expert Dr. Robert Anderson last night. A three-month absence puts Burrow’s timeline for return somewhere around mid-December. How the Bengals are faring at that time could ultimately determine whether or not we see him again in 2025 or if they opt to shelve him until 2026. For now, this is Jake Browning’s team going forward. He’ll make his first start of the season in Week 3 against the Vikings.</description>

      <title>KPRC2’s Aaron Wilson reports the Commanders are working out free agent RB Demetric Felton.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4dc2-d294-a19b-edf215000000</link>
      <description>Felton spent all of training camp with the Commanders and can provide the pass-catching threat the Commanders lost after Austin Ekeler’s Achilles injury. Even if Felton lands in Washington, it seems unlikely the team would move to activate him on game day early on. Veteran Jeremy McNichols will likely get the first crack at a third-down role and has 49 career receptions to his name. Felton hasn’t played an offensive snap since 2022.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Cowboys C Cooper Beebe is expected to miss 6-8 weeks with a high-ankle sprain.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4dc6-dc44-a9d9-4fe6c9660000</link>
      <description>Brock Hoffman replaced Beebe in Week 2’s game against the Giants after Beebe exited late in Sunday’s contest. Beebe’s 6-8 week absence will put him on track for a return sometime in November if all goes well. Beebe is in his second season with the team after being drafted in the third round of the 2024 NFL Draft, and he played on 1,059 offensive snaps for the Cowboys last season. His absence will be felt by a Cowboys offensive line that was under duress from the Giants all day on Sunday. Rapoport later reported that “based on the testing,” the Cowboys are hopeful Beebe can return in six weeks.</description>
