      <title>Kenneth Walker III (foot) practiced in full on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b98c-d90d-a5bd-bbdf315d0000</link>
      <description>Foot soreness has bothered Walker for some time, and he even had a few recent absences due to undisclosed reasons. We assume the latter absences were because of the foot as well. The Seahawks can be slow to confirm these things, though. It would be great to see Walker string together a few injury-free practices this week. He is expected to fully participate in the Seahawks’ joint practice with the Packers on Thursday. Fantasy managers can use that outing as a benchmark for his foot recovery process. The Seahawks are expected to employ a run-heavy attack under new OC Klint Kubiak, with Walker functioning as the featured offensive weapon.</description>

      <title>Panthers signed QB Bryce Perkins, formerly of the UFL, to a contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b9a7-d90d-a5bd-bbff9f410000</link>
      <description>Perkins quarterbacked the UFL’s Memphis Panthers last year, winning the UFL MVP award, the UFL Offensive Player of the Year award and earning a spot on the All-UFL team. He completed 109-of-158 passes for 1,342 yards, nine touchdowns and two interceptions. He rushed 46 times for 274 yards and five touchdowns while fumbling five times. Panthers backup QB Andy Dalton suffered an elbow injury in the team’s preseason Week 2 game against the Texans.</description>

      <title>Seahawks WR Tory Horton (ankle) did not practice on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b96c-d90d-a5bd-bb7f31e70000</link>
      <description>Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said the injury does not appear to be serious. Horton injured the ankle in the Seahawks’ preseason Week 2 game against the Chiefs on Friday. The Day 3 rookie had been separating from journeyman WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling. An extended absence would give MVS a second chance to secure the role.</description>

      <title>Broncos signed FB Adam Prentice, formerly of the Saints, to a contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b9ca-d90d-a5bd-bbdb654f0000</link>
      <description>Prentice’s signing makes sense, at least in the short term. The Broncos’ starting FB Michael Burton is dealing with a hamstring injury. It’s unlikely the team will keep two fullbacks on the active roster, though. The Broncos correspondingly placed OG Nick Gargiulo on injured reserve.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Daniel Oyefusi reports that the Browns are expected to announce their starting quarterback for Week 1 soon.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b9b7-d90d-a5bd-bbff0acc0000</link>
      <description>Joe Flacco, now 40 years old, is somehow the only healthy quarterback on the Browns roster. Both Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel are nursing hamstring injuries, though Gabriel played in preseason Week 2 and suffered no setbacks. Shedeur Sanders, meanwhile, is dealing with an oblique injury. Flacco has also reportedly been the steadiest performer in practice. It is likely his job to lose. He is not fantasy-relevant in re-draft formats.</description>

      <title>Tank Bigsby rushed two times for six yards and caught 1-of-1 targets for 19 yards in the Jaguars’ preseason Week 2 game against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b9fd-d05a-adda-bbff96480000</link>
      <description>Bigsby returned the opening kickoff for 36 yards before handling the first play from scrimmage, a two-yard run up the middle. Last week, Travis Etienne started and played nearly the entire first drive. This week, Bigsby got the start and stayed on-field for 7-of-9 first-drive snaps. He clocked two snaps on the second drive but after that, his day was done. His best play came via a 2nd-and-8 screen pass, which he took across the field while forcing two missed tackles and setting up his blocks well. It was a good showing for Bigsby, as he and Etienne jockey for the Week 1 starting role. Bhashul Tuten should not be discounted, though.</description>

      <title>Travis Etienne Jr. rushed three times for 24 yards and caught 1-of-1 targets for eight yards in the Jaguars’ preseason Week 2 game against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba0b-d90d-a5bd-ba5b705a0000</link>
      <description>Etienne subbed in for both third downs on the Jaguars’ first offensive drive. He then played 6-of-8 snaps on the second drive before being done for the day. Etienne and Tank Bigsby will seemingly duke it out for the starting job next week, though Bhayshul Tuten continues to play well behind them.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba0b-d90d-a5bd-ba5b705a0000</guid>

      <title>Bhayshul Tuten rushed 10 times for 35 yards and one touchdown and caught 1-of-1 targets for six yards in the Jaguars’ preseason Week 2 game against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b9d4-d05a-adda-bbd68d610000</link>
      <description>Tuten continues to look good, playing with the second team. Though he stands just 5'9/209, Tuten’s ability to fight through contact and move the pile on inside runs really jumps off the screen. He scored his second preseason touchdown on a three-yard run up the middle against the Saints, muscling past DB Jordan Howden, who attempted to go low on the spry rookie rusher. He should continue to be drafted as a high-upside bench stash.</description>

      <title>Brian Thomas Jr. caught 2-of-4 targets for eight yards and rushed once for two yards in the Jaguars’ preseason Week 2 game against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba10-d05a-adda-ba92feb50000</link>
      <description>Thomas’ creative preseason usage continued in this one.He took 6-of-16 snaps lined up in the slot, with one such play resulting in a sneaky handoff. The talented, young receiver is a WR1 entering year two as a pro.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba10-d05a-adda-ba92feb50000</guid>

      <title>Jordan Schultz reports that the Commanders “have been shopping RB Brian Robinson Jr. to teams around the NFL.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba20-df63-a199-fb2b212e0000</link>
      <description>Robinson averaged fewer than 4.0 yards per carry in five of his final seven games last year, and the Commanders are said to be focused on creating more explosive plays this season. Enter Day 3 rookie RB Jacory Croskey-Merritt, who has steadily earned the coaching staff’s praise through spring and summer practices. The team also has RB Chris Rodriguez Jr. under contract this year, who boasts a career 4.9 YPC average through two seasons operating as a rotational rusher. Robinson is scheduled to enter free agency at the end of the year. If the front office feels good about Croskey-Merritt and Rodriguez, it makes sense for them to send Robinson away in exchange for future draft capital or a young player at a position of need.</description>
