      <title>NFL will interview Browns RB Quinshon Judkins this week in relation to his domestic battery case.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1ffb-dbe3-a9bb-3ffb6d7c0000</link>
      <description>The criminal charges against Judkins were dropped relating to a domestic battery case in July, which allowed him to sign with the Browns earlier Saturday. That said, he still faces potential league discipline per the personal conduct policy, the proceedings of which are set to begin this week. The findings of the league investigation will be presented to Judge Sue L. Robinson, after which a recommended punishment will be handed down. Judkins can appeal any ruling but it certainly seems likely he will miss more time in Cleveland.</description>

      <title>Dolphins elevated K Riley Patterson and RB Jeff Wilson ahead of their Week 1 game against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2014-dbe3-a9bb-305716630000</link>
      <description>Wilson gets the game day elevation in the wake of Jaylen Wright’s injury while the Dolphins entered Week 1 preparations without a kicker on the active roster. De’Von Achane remains the unquestioned top back while rookie Ollie Gordon appears set to step into the primary change of pace role, leaving Wilson as a likely emergency back. The team also did not elevate a tight end, meaning they will take on the Colts with only Julian Hill and Tanner Conner with Darren Waller set to miss.</description>

      <title>Texans elevated WR Jared Wayne ahead of Week 1 against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-202a-dbe3-a9bb-307ba87f0000</link>
      <description>Wayne’s standard elevation was expected following injuries to fellow wide receiver Christian Kirk and Braxton Berrios, leaving the team thin at the position. he could find himself active in the coming weeks as well pending the length of recovery for Kirk and Berrios.</description>

      <title>Rams elevated RB Cody Schrader from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-202d-d332-a1fd-b63f21450000</link>
      <description>It’s an interesting development considering we rarely see Sean McVay teams hold four active backs on game day, a potential hint that the team could be primed to make rookie Jarquez Hunter a healthy inactive for the team’s Week 1 contest against the Texans. Schrader enters his second year in the league and was active on two occasions late last season.</description>

      <title>Bears RB Kyle Monangai is off the injury report and will play in Week 1 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2050-db7b-a5dd-a054fe330000</link>
      <description>Fellow running back Roschon Johnon is listed as questionable after getting in a limited session Saturday, potentially paving the way for Monangai to serve as the primary change of pace option in his first professional appearance for the Bears. Joining Johnson as questionable for Monday Night Football are DB Jaylon Johnson and DB Josh Blackwell, while LB T.J. Edwards is listed as doubtful with a hamstring injury.</description>

      <title>Vikings S Harrison Smith (illness) is doubtful for Week 1 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2066-d332-a1fd-b676a94c0000</link>
      <description>Smith was absent from practice Thursday but upgraded to a limited showing Friday, ultimately drawing the doubtful tag after missing practice Saturday. LT Christian Darrisaw is listed as questionable as he works his way back from a devastating knee injury suffered in Week 8 of the 2024 season, while both RB Zavier Scott and DT Elijah Williams have both been ruled out.</description>

      <title>Saints waived QB Jake Haener and signed DE Fadil Diggs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-206d-de13-afdd-66ef66b60000</link>
      <description>Haener was the betting favorite to win the starting quarterback job for the Saints before they went with Spencer Rattler under center. He was released by the team as they trimmed down to 53, signed to the practice squad, and then re-signed to the active roster within a week before his eventual release. The team signed DE Fadil Diggs in a corresponding move.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey (calf) is likely to play in Week 1 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2092-de13-afdd-66db97bf0000</link>
      <description>McCaffrey popped on the team’s injury report Thursday with a calf injury, something fantasy managers remember all too well prior to the 2024 season before the veteran back eventually missed the first half of the season. He would then sit out Friday’s session entirely. “Barring a setback, it’s likely he’ll go,” Rapoport stated on X Saturday amidst mounting rumors. McCaffrey continues to insist he is fine and will suit up, stating Friday the “feels great” and that everything has been “blown out of proportion.” Even so, fantasy managers will want to monitor his situation closely and potentially line up alternative plans considering the 49ers don’t kick off until the afternoon in Week 1.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports Patriots OT Will Campbell is “on track” to play in Week 1 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2098-dbe3-a9bb-30db9a1e0000</link>
      <description>Campbell was added to the team’s injury report Thursday with an ankle injury but signs are now pointing to him suiting up in Week 1 against the Raiders. The No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft is set to make an immediate impact protecting quarterback Drake Maye’s blindside as part of a retooled offensive line in New England.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports Buccaneers NT Vita Vea (foot) is likely to play in Week 1 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-20a6-d332-a1fd-b6b6c7d50000</link>
      <description>Vea has been a stalwart defender throughout his career and is a big reason for the teams continued successes against the run, making his likely presence when the Buccaneers take the field in Week 1 against the Falcons a significant boost to their defense. It seems a full practice Friday was enough for coaches to confidently start Vea to begin the season.</description>
