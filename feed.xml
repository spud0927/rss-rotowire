      <description>In back-to-back games without Kincaid, Knox has failed deliver any kind of meaningful production for fantasy managers. The veteran tight end is sitting on a 4-40-0 line on seven targets over the last two weeks, and can be left on waivers for Week 12’s game against the Steelers.</description>

      <title>Woody Marks rushed 16 times for 74 yards in the Texans’ Week 12 win over the Bills.</title>

      <description>Marks continues to lead the Texans backfield in volume but the production remains inconsistent. The rookie running back has totaled double-digit touches in six-straight games but has only two touchdowns to show for that, and his 74 yards on Thursday set a new season/career-high. His lack of upside in the passing game continues to make him a boom-or-bust RB2 heading into Week 13’s game against the Colts.</description>

      <title>Nico Collins caught 3-of-3 targets for 55 yards in the Texans’ Week 12 win over the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a4d9-d90e-a9da-bfdf17ce0000</link>
      <description>Collins hauled in a 24-yard reception early in the second quarter to help kickstart a drive that ended with a Christian Kirk touchdown. It was a relatively disappointing outing for the Texans’ WR1, whose struggles can be partly blamed on the offense struggling to sustain drives and stay on the field. Collins doesn’t turn out weeks like this too often, and should profile as a fringe WR1/WR2 play in Week 13 against the Colts with C.J. Stroud (concussion) likely back under center.</description>

      <title>Christian Kirk caught 5-of-6 targets for 54 yards and a touchdown in the Texans’ Week 12 win over the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a4dc-db57-afda-f6fe7c910000</link>
      <description>Week 12 marked one of the more productive days for Kirk, whose two-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter gave the Texans their first lead of the day. The veteran receiver later hauled in a 33-yard reception in the in the same quarter to help set Jayden Higgins up for an eight-yard touchdown to give the Texans the lead entering the half. It’s only the second time this season that Kirk has topped 26 receiving yards, and his five receptions were a new season high. Despite the decent showing, fantasy managers shouldn’t be rushing to start him in Week 13 against the Colts.</description>

      <title>Jayden Higgins caught 4-of-9 targets for 38 yards and a touchdown in the Texans’ Week 12 win over the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a4e1-d90e-a9da-bfefc4910000</link>
      <description>Higgins continues to be a key contributor in the red zone, scoring this time on an eight-yard touchdown just before halftime to give the Texans the lead. The rookie remains heavily involved in the offense with Davis Mills under center, but was seeing decent target volume from C.J. Stroud before his injury. The yardage has been underwhelming, but Higgins is clearly viewed as a reliable option in the passing game, averaging 7.7 targets per game in his last three games. Higgins will be on the WR4/WR5 radar in Week 13’s game against the Colts.</description>

      <title>Dalton Schultz caught 1-of-4 targets for eight yards in the Texans’ Week 12 win over the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a4e6-d90e-a9da-bfef650d0000</link>
      <description>Thursday’s game against the Bills was easily the worst of the season for Schultz, who had gone for 50-plus yards in five of his last six games entering the night. The Texans saw the majority of their production come in the second quarter of Thursday’s win, but struggled to sustain drives for much of the night. Schultz should be in store for a better Week 13 against the Colts, we’re he’ll profile as a fringe TE1/TE2.</description>

      <title>Commanders team president Mark Clouse said the team will play an international game in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a707-db57-afda-f737443e0000</link>
      <description>The Commanders are fresh off an international game in Madrid, Spain, and will be set to run things back again in 2026 at a location that is yet to be decided. That said, we do know the Commanders will be the “home team” in said international game, meaning there will be one less home game for fans to attend stateside next season. Next season will mark the third time the Commanders have played internationally, and the first time they have done so in consecutive seasons. Hopefully, fans will be treated to a start by Jayden Daniels after being forced to watch Marcus Mariota vs. Tua Tagovailoa in Week 12, but regardless, it’s clear the Commanders are a team the league wants to push into international markets.</description>

      <title>Cardinals HC Jonathan Gannon said RT OT Jonah Williams will undergo shoulder surgery and miss the remainder of the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a734-d90e-a9da-bf3f795e0000</link>
      <description>Williams has started all nine games he’s appeared in for the Cardinals this season, but missed Week 11’s game due to his shoulder injury. The veteran tackle has allowed 21 pressures and three sacks this season while earning a PFF grade of 55.9, and is in the final year of a two-year deal he signed last offseason. Williams, 28, has 74 games of starting experience under his belt and should have plenty of suitors next season if the Cardinals don’t opt to bring him back.</description>

      <title>Jaxson Dart (concussion) will not play in Week 12 against the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a740-d413-ad9f-b7ddf4c60000</link>
      <description>Dart logged back-to-back limited practices to open the week, but the rookie signal-caller will miss his second-straight game with his brain injury. This will put Jameis Winston in line to start against the Lions, who currently rank eighth in passing yards allowed but have also surrendered the ninth-most passing touchdowns on the season. Winston threw for 201 yards and one pick in his first start of the season, and will be in the QB2 range for fantasy.</description>

      <description>Winston gets the nod for a second consecutive week after Jaxson Dart was unable to clear the league’s concussion protocol. Last week against the Packers, Winston threw for 201-0-1 on 29 passes, but did punch in a short rushing touchdown to salvage an otherwise disappointing fantasy day. Winston will be on the fantasy radar as a mid QB2 with four teams on bye, but he matches up against a Lions defense that ranks eighth in passing yards allowed this season.</description>
