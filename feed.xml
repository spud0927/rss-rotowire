      <title>Panthers HC Dave Canales said EDGE Nic Scourton (lung) is “doing great” and could practice next week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d274-db7b-a5dd-f274bcfa0000</link>
      <description>Scourton suffered a collapsed lung just over a week ago and has been sidelined ever since. The rookie pass-rusher appears to be trending toward a return and could even be on track to play in Week 1 against the Jaguars if he’s able to log enough practices leading up to game day.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Joe Person believes Hunter Renfrow may not be a lock to make the Panthers’ 53-man roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d289-dbe3-a9bb-f2dbfcf20000</link>
      <description>It’s worth pointing out that in his latest roster projections, Person has Renfrow making the roster. The former Pro Bowler battled through a hamstring injury during part of camp, but has reportedly impressed in camp. Person believes “others in the organization are higher on Renfrow” than head coach Dave Canales, which could be why the 29-year-old slot receiver remains firmly on the roster bubble even with a strong camp. Renfrow’s chances of making the roster improve if the Panthers were to trade Adam Thielen to the Vikings, a move that has reportedly been discussed between the two teams. Even if he makes the roster, it’s hard to imagine Renfrow having much, if any, fantasy impact in 2025.</description>

      <title>49ers acquired RB Brian Robinson from the Commanders in exchange for a sixth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d296-db7b-a5dd-f296aaef0000</link>
      <description>The Commanders’ trading Robinson felt like a lock after it was announced last week that the team was shopping the fourth-year back. A day later, Robinson and the Commanders mutually agreed to sit him in the team’s preseason game against the Bengals, and now he’ll be on his way to the Bay Area to help a depleted Niners backfield. Robinson rushed for 799 yards and eight touchdowns in his first season in Kliff Kingsbury’s offense, but wasn’t deemed a scheme fit by the season’s end. The selection of Jacory “Bill” Croskey-Merritt, who has impressed in camp, has made Robinson expendable, and a now valuable addition to the Niners. He should immediately slot in as the RB2 behind Christian McCaffrey, but it seems unlikely that he will earn much work if McCaffrey sees his normal workload. Robinson is a solid between-the-tackles grinder who has averaged 4.1 YPC for his career. He could make for a decent handcuff in deeper leagues if McCaffrey were ever to miss time.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports “financial hurdles remain before any potential Adam Thielen-Vikings reunion can occur.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d293-dbe3-a9bb-f2d3ad980000</link>
      <description>Russini points out that in March, the Panthers bumped up Thielen’s 2025 salary. The 35-year-old receiver comes with a cap hit just north of $10.108 million this season, per Over the Cap, and the Vikings have already been working to increase their cap flexibility with the trade of Harrison Phillips earlier in the week. Thielen would be a natural fit in the Vikings’ offense if a trade is able to get done, but there’s still plenty to work out here.</description>

      <title>Giants released WR Zach Pascal.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d2e0-d332-a1fd-d6f6ffee0000</link>
      <description>Pascal is again looking for work after being a part of the Giants’ initial cutdown to 53 players. The 30-year-old receiver has bounced between three different teams since 2022 and didn’t catch a pass in 17 games with the Cardinals last season. In addition to Pascal, the Giants also cut WR Jordan Bly, LB K.J. Cloyd, CB O’Donnell Fortune, LB Dyontae Johnson, C Jimmy Morrissey, WR Montrell Washington, and OL Jaison Williams.</description>

      <title>Steelers released QB Logan Woodside.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d30a-dbe3-a9bb-f35b5fe80000</link>
      <description>The Steelers also released LB Kenny Willekes and LS Jake McQuaide and waived RB Evan Hull, CB Kam Alexander, S Quindell Johnson, DB Kyler McMichael, DB Mikey Victor, OG Doug Nester, OT Julian Pearl and TE Kevin Foelsch. The two biggest names here are Woodside and Hull. Both players will likely be offered tryouts and/or practice squad spots at some point.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler said the Cowboys would need a “Herculean” offer to consider trading EDGE Micah Parsons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d306-d332-a1fd-d7361ea30000</link>
      <description>Fowler uses the Cowboys’ 1989 Herschel Walker trade with the Vikings as an example. The Vikings gave the Cowboys five players attached to conditional draft picks, plus six more future draft picks, to acquire the star running back. Fowler adds that the Cowboys have received “multiple trade inquiries” for Parsons, but the team is currently “not entertaining” them. Fowler’s Cowboys sources “remain optimistic” about signing Parsons to an extension, but “on the players’ side, not so much optimism.” Fowler also said that the Packers, Cardinals, Ravens and “even some teams in Dallas’ own division,” make sense as potential trade partners.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers signed CB Tre Avery, formerly of the Patriots, to a contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d358-dbe3-a9bb-f35be8f70000</link>
      <description>Avery forced one incompletion on eight targets, playing for the Patriots in the 2025 preseason. He played for both the Titans and 49ers in 2024. The Buccaneers waived WR Jaden Smith in a corresponding move.</description>

      <title>Patriots waived TE Jaheim Bell.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d364-d332-a1fd-d776eae60000</link>
      <description>Bell was an intriguing receiving tight end in the 2024 NFL Draft. The Patriots also waived RB Micah Bernard, DT Philip Blidi, DB Isaiah Bolden, TE Cole Fotheringham, WR Phil Lutz, LB R.J. Moten, CB Jordan Polk, OG Tyrese Robinson, OG Sidy Sow, RB Shane Watts and QB Ben Wooldridge and released DT Kyle Peko, LB Monty Rice</description>

      <title>Steelers DT Derrick Harmon (knee) expected to miss “about a month” and is a candidate to begin the year on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-d373-d332-a1fd-d77721620000</link>
      <description>Harmon was diagnosed with an MCL sprain. No word yet on the specific severity. Being placed on injured reserve would require him to miss at least four games, and the Steelers notably have a Week 5 bye. The good news is that the Steelers will get their first-round rookie back this year. The bad news is that they face four capable rushing offenses to begin the year (Jets, Seahawks, Patriots and Vikings).</description>
