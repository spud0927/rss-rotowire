      <title>Justin Herbert (hand) is questionable for Week 14 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f51f-d77b-adfa-ff9fa27e0000</link>
      <description>Herbert is expected to play, but the questionable tag suggests that it’s far from a lock. The 27-year-old signal-caller suffered a fracture on his non-throwing hand against the Raiders in Week 13, but assuming there are no setbacks, he should be under center for Monday Night Football against the Eagles.</description>

      <title>Steelers elevated WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f543-d8cf-affb-fd6b279f0000</link>
      <description>Valdes-Scantling is on his third organization, and will have a chance to make his Steelers’ debut after signing with the team early in November. The 31-year-old wideout has familiarity with Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh wideout corps aren’t exactly spectacular, but it’s hard to invision much fantasy upside for the remainder of 2025.</description>

      <title>Saints elevated K Charlie Smyth from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f54f-d8cf-affb-fd6fc8050000</link>
      <description>Smyth nailed a 56-yard field goal in his NFL debut in Week 13, and the product of Ireland will once again handle kicking duties for the Saints in Week 14 against the Buccaneers. His strong leg and New Orleans’ inability to complete drives makes him worthy of consideration for those who get added points for lengthier field goals.</description>

      <title>Chiefs signed S Mike Edwards from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f555-d8cf-affb-fd7f6af60000</link>
      <description>Edwards, 29, made his first appearance of the season against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving, and the former starter will be a depth option for Kansas City in their Week 14 tilt against the Texans.</description>

      <title>Hassan Haskins (hamstring) is questionable for Week 14 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f568-d8cf-affb-fd6ac8a20000</link>
      <description>Haskins is currently on injured reserve with his hamstring issue, and hasn’t been able to play since Week 7. The former fourth-round pick would be a backup — presumably for Omarion Hampton (ankle) — option if he can go Monday night against the Eagles.</description>

      <title>Packers activated Jayden Reed (foot/shoulder) off injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f58f-da9b-a9bf-ff8fb6b20000</link>
      <description>Reed was activated, but that doesn’t mean the wideout will play in Week 14 against the Bears. The Packers are listening the third-year wideout as questionable for that contest, and there’s just as good of chance that he’ll return to action in Week 15 as this Sunday. Reed last played in Week 2. If he can actually suit up, he’ll knock Dontayvion Wicks out of the top 70, and perhaps render Romeo Doubs and even Christian Watson a bit more volatile.</description>

      <title>Commanders activated WR Noah Brown (groin) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f595-da9b-a9bf-ff9d5fcd0000</link>
      <description>Facing the Vikings, Brown will be active for the first time since Week 2. He figures to immediately slot back in as the No. 3 wideout for an offense that has been dealing with receiver injury carnage all season. Good news for Washington, especially with Jayden Daniels also returning, but it’s unlikely to make a ripple in fantasy football.</description>

      <title>Cardinals placed WR Greg Dortch (chest) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f592-da9b-a9bf-ff9fd9a30000</link>
      <description>Dortch could return for the Week 18 finale, but it’s likely that the season is over for the 27-year-old. Assuming his campaign is done, he finishes 2025 with 29 receptions for 2026 yards and three touchdowns. Trent Sherfield has been promoted from the practice squad to take Dortch’s place.</description>

      <title>Ty Chandler (knee) won’t play in Week 14 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f59d-da9b-a9bf-ff9db42b0000</link>
      <description>Chandler will not come off injured reserve, so the Vikings will once again go with a Jordan Mason-Aaron Jones backfield for the tilt against the Commanders. Chandler likely wouldn’t have a big role/won’t have one whenever he is activated, anyways.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f59d-da9b-a9bf-ff9db42b0000</guid>

      <title>Jets signed QB Brady Cook from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f59f-da9b-a9bf-ff9fbbe20000</link>
      <description>Cook will be the backup signal-caller for the Week 14 contest against the Dolphins, as Justin Fields (knee) has been ruled out for that contest versus Miami.</description>
