      <title>Denver Gazette’s Chris Tomasson reports the Broncos are considering placing J.K. Dobbins (foot) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-750d-d673-a39e-f59de2c70000</link>
      <description>He apparently picked up the injury during Thursday night’s riveting win over the Raiders, though he played through it at the time while the Broncos closed out the game. If Dobbins is an IR candidate, he’s definitely a candidate to sit this week, which should be a big boost for RJ Harvey and probably make Tyler Badie a FLEX consideration as well.</description>

      <title>Patriots TE Austin Hooper (concussion) did not participate in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7523-d713-ad9e-7d779f500000</link>
      <description>Hooper was diagnosed with a concussion and also did not practice on Monday. The Patriots play on a short week against the Jets on Thursday, making a return to the field unlikely for Hooper in Week 11. Expect more looks for Hunter Henry as practice squad tight end C.J. Dippre may be called up to play a small role this week.</description>

      <title>FOX NFL’s Jay Glazer reports Eagles CB Jaire Alexander is stepping away from football.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-756d-d1e7-a1fa-7fef06a40000</link>
      <description>Glazer reports Alexander is stepping away from football “to focus on getting himself right physically and mentally before deciding on his future.” The 28-year-old appeared in two games for the Ravens this season before the Eagles acquired him for a late-round pick swap prior to the trade deadline. Alexander has struggled to stay healthy each of the last three seasons, appearing in a combined 16 games since the start of the 2023 season. He most recently was dealing with a knee issue and could not get fully healthy to contribute to either the Eagles or Ravens this year. Now, it appears he is stepping away from the Eagles and football to determine his physical and mental health before choosing a path for the future. Alexander is not yet retired, but he is unlikely to be a contributor for the 2025 season.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports QB Jameis Winston will start in Week 11 if Jaxson Dart (concussion) is out.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7856-d713-ad9e-7c56f82c0000</link>
      <description>Winston is being bumped to the QB2 role behind Dart, according to Russini. That means Russell Wilson — a favorite of recently fired head coach Brian Daboll — has been demoted to the emergency QB3 role ahead of the Giants’ Week 11 game against the Packers. Winston’s hair-on-fire play might not be great for real football purposes, but his aggressiveness and willingness to push the ball downfield should benefit Darius Slayton, Theo Johnson, and Wan’Dale Robinson if he gets the start against Green Bay. Dart last week suffered yet another head injury and has a good chance of missing at least one game. Winston should be rostered in all superflex fantasy formats this week.</description>

      <title>The Tampa Bay Times’ Rick Stroud reports Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot) and Chris Godwin (fibula) are in “rehab mode.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-78b0-d1e7-a1fa-7afa7ff40000</link>
      <description>It’s not a great mode to be in as the Bucs head into their Week 11 matchup against the Bills. Stroud said he did not expected Godwin or Irving to practice Wednesday, and both players would seem unlikely to suit up against Buffalo. Look for Rachaad White and Sean Tucker to continue splitting the Bucs’ backfield workload against a weak Buffalo rush defense, and for Tez Johnson to operate as the team’s WR2 with Godwin sidelined.</description>

      <title>Giants QB Jaxson Dart entered the NFL’s concussion protocol.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-78d1-d673-a39e-fcd13d530000</link>
      <description>Dart was out cold on the turf in Week 10 against the Bears after slamming his head on the ground in the third quarter. He was checked for a head injury for the fourth time this season before being escorted to the locker room, where he remained for the rest of the contest. Dart is almost certain to miss Week 11 against the Packers. The Giants moved Jameis Winston into the QB2 role ahead of Week 11, meaning Winston would get the starting nod should Dart miss the game. Russell Wilson will serve as New York’s emergency QB3 now that Russ loyalist Brian Daboll is out.</description>

      <title>Bucky Irving (shoulder) returned to practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-78dd-d673-a39e-fcddd83b0000</link>
      <description>Bucs beat writers described Wednesday’s session as a walk-through, meaning Irving wasn’t practicing in full while battling shoulder and foot issues that have plagued him since mid-September. With continued practice participation on Thursday and Friday, Irving could make his return to game action this week against Buffalo. The Bucs could also wait another week to make sure Irving is back to full health before re-installing him as the team’s starting back.</description>

      <title>Marvin Harrison Jr. (appendicitis) is out for Week 11.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7901-d713-ad9e-7d55420e0000</link>
      <description>Harrison underwent surgery to address to appendicitis and will be sidelined for at least one week, according to the Cardinals. Harrison’s absence comes as Jacoby Brissett — with Kyler Murray on IR — has breathed new life into the previously dormant Arizona passing attack. The Cardinals will also be without Zay Jones, who injured his Achilles in Week 10’s loss against Seattle. Look for Greg Dortch to take on a full-time role this week against a weak 49ers pass defense. Michael Wilson could see a slight increase in targets with MHJ sidelined. Trey McBride will continue seeing ample targets in the pass-first Arizona offense.</description>

      <title>Bills head coach Sean McDermott said he’s “excited” about WR Mecole Hardman.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-790d-d673-a39e-fd9dc6440000</link>
      <description>McDermott complimented the “flexibility” Hardman brings to the offense. The Bills on Tuesday signed Hardman to their practice squad. The longtime Chiefs gadget player and kicker returner could suit up for the Bills as soon as Week 11 against the Bucs. He had just 26 receptions over his past final two seasons with the Chiefs and hasn’t scored a regular season touchdown since 2022. Hardman will likely be a situational player in the run-heavy Buffalo offense.</description>

      <title>Giants QB Jameis Winston will start Week 11 against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7927-d45b-affe-7db712780000</link>
      <description>Interim head coach Mike Kafka made the announcement after Jaxson Dart was placed in the league’s concussion protocol. Winston’s aggressiveness and willingness to push the ball downfield should benefit Darius Slayton, Theo Johnson, and Wan’Dale Robinson in Week 11 and beyond, if Dart misses more time while recovering from his latest head injury. Winston last season in Cleveland threw 13 touchdowns to 12 picks over seven starts. He averaged nearly 300 passing yards per game for the Browns. Winston should be picked up in all superflex formats.</description>
