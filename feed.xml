      <title>Ravens HC John Harbaugh said DeAndre Hopkins is “working on his knee a little bit” when asked about an injury update.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bee8-d90d-a5bd-befbae9d0000</link>
      <description>It’s not much of an update, but Harbaugh also didn’t sound like a coach overly concerned about Hopkins’ Week 1 availability. Hopkins’ knee injury was first reported on July 24, but the veteran receiver has still participated in some practices since then. We’ll assume that Monday’s absence isn’t much more than a management day until the team gives us reason to fear otherwise.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “there’s an increasing feeling that the Browns will carry four QBs on their 53-man roster.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bef2-d05a-adda-bef2b8df0000</link>
      <description>The Browns’ decision to keep four quarterbacks on the roster has felt like a possibility ever since they drafted Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round, following his unprecedented fall. Both Sanders and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel have always been near locks to make the roster, and with Joe Flacco the unquestioned QB1, the only decision to really be made was whether or not to retain Kenny Pickett. The Browns’ quarterback room isn’t great. At best, it’s a room full of question marks that may or may not have a franchise quarterback in the waiting, such as Gabriel or Sanders, but that’s still to be determined. Rostering four quarterbacks in hopes of getting a look at the younger guys later in the season feels like the most logical move for a team that has plenty of questions to answer at the position this season and beyond.</description>

      <title>Dolphins signed EDGE Matthew Judon, formerly of the Falcons, to a one-year contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bf00-d45c-a7fc-bf1a46820000</link>
      <description>NFL insider Jordan Schultz was the first to report the actual signing. Judon will head to the Fins to serve in what will likely be a situational pass-rush role. During three seasons with the Patriots, Judon totaled 32 sacks in 38 games, but managed just 5.5 sacks in 17 games with the Falcons last season. Set to enter his age-33 year, it’s fair to assume his best years are behind him, but Judon should still have enough in the tank to offer a defense in a lighter-used role.</description>

      <title>Patriots GM Eliot Wolf praised UDFA Efton Chism on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bdc0-df63-a199-fdeb0f230000</link>
      <description>The undrafted Eastern Washington product has been tearing up the preseason gridiron after a hype-filled offseason program. “I think he’s got tremendous football instincts,” Wolf gushed. “I think he’s tremendous at the top of the route. His play strength for a shorter guy is very good. We’re excited about what he can bring to our football team.” Quotes can be deceiving this time of year, but Wolf is certainly talking like Chism will make the 53-man roster. Fantasy managers need to remember that is Step 1. Step 2 — generating actual value — probably wouldn’t come until 2026, but Chism remains an intriguing end-of-bench stash in Dynasty leagues, and maybe, just maybe someone to put on re-draft watch lists.</description>

      <title>Cowboys WR Jonathan Mingo (PCL) to miss 4-6 weeks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bfa7-d45c-a7fc-bfbf6cd60000</link>
      <description>The injury effectively closes the door on the team’s WR3 battle, with third-year pro Jalen Tolbert almost assuredly in line to start the season in the starting lineup alongside CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens. Mingo has yet to fully pan out in the NFL and joined the Cowboys during the 2024 regular season, with the team hopeful a change of scenery could ignite his career. It appears as if he has avoided surgery but he could start the season on injured reserve/designated to return.</description>

      <title>Joe Burrow completed 9-of-14 passes for 62 yards and one touchdown in the Bengals’ preseason Week 2 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bfac-d90d-a5bd-bfff93190000</link>
      <description>That now makes five offensive drives with the starters for Burrow this preseason. The Bengals have scored on four of those possessions while Burrow has gone a combined 18-of-24 for 185 yards and three touchdowns. The offense surely looks to be ready for games to count. The same cannot be said of the Cincinnati defense. Burrow and the Bengals could be forced into similar game environments to what they grew accustomed to in 2024, typically needing to maximize scoring with each possession due to the shortcomings of their defense. Things are certainly setting up for massive volume for Burrow and the rest of the core offensive pieces in the coming season.</description>

      <title>Jacory Croskey-Merritt rushed 11 times for 46 yards and a touchdown in the Commanders’ preseason Week 2 game against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bfe2-d45c-a7fc-bffaeb5c0000</link>
      <description>It was Chris Rodriguez that drew the start after Brian Robinson and the Commanders mutually agreed that the veteran back would not play amidst news of the team shopping him, but both backs looked spry in the preseason tuneup. Roriguez got the fun started with a 40-yard scamper on the team’s first possession before Jacory, ahem, Bill, Croskey-Merritt found paint from 27 yards out on the following possession. The two almost certainly sealed the fate of Robinson in Washington with the team seemingly more than content moving forward without his services during a contract year. It shouldn’t take long for Bill to assert himself in this backfield if we are to believe the glaring reports coming from camp this offseason.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Nicki Jhabvala reports RB Austin Ekeler remains a “key piece” of the Commanders offense.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c23c-df63-a199-db3f74830000</link>
      <description>As Brian Robinson trade rumors circulate ahead of the regular season, and as rookie RB Jacory Croskey-Merritt gains steam as a potential lead back in the run-first Washington offense, Ekeler, 30, should remain the team’s primary pass-catching backfield option who could cut into Croskey-Merritt’s workload early in the season, along with Chris Rodriguez. Robinson was held out of Monday night’s preseason game against the Bengals. JCM and Rodriguez shined against Cincinnati; the rookie rumbled for 46 yards and a score on 11 attempts. Ekeler in 2024 led the Commanders backfield with 35 receptions for 366 yards. He could have some value in deeper PPR formats this season if Robinson is traded away.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports “it’s hard to find anyone” in the NFL who believes Terry McLaurin will get the contract he’s seeking.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c281-de13-afdc-c6cb51890000</link>
      <description>Russini spoke with league officials and concluded McLaurin is a long shot to land a deal in the $30 million per year range ahead of the 2025 regular season. McLaurin, headed into his age-30 season, has not participated in any offseason activities and has expressed persistent frustration with the team’s refusal to meet his demands. If McLaurin continues to hold out in the regular season, Deebo Samuel would likely operate as the Commanders’ No. 1 wideout, with Noah Brown working as the team’s WR2. Michael Gallup could see a good number of snaps and routes too.</description>

      <title>Packers WR Dontayvion Wicks (calf) won’t practice this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c29e-dbe3-a9bb-f2df759c0000</link>
      <description>Wicks tried to play through a lingering calf issue in early August but has been sidelined since August 2 with no firm return date in sight. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Tom Silverstein said “there’s hope” Wicks — a mistake-prone downfield threat — could be ready for Green Bay’s Week 1 game against the Lions. Wicks in 2024 had 15 yards and five touchdowns on just 39 receptions as a rotational option in the Packers run-heavy offense. He could be a staple in three-receiver sets to start the season with Christian Watson (knee) slated to miss the regular season’s first month.</description>
