      <title>Rams RB Kyren Williams (ankle) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 14 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f06a-d005-a9bf-f87e26a50000</link>
      <description>Williams was limited for the week’s first two practices, but upgraded to full on Friday. He will likely continue to split time with No. 2 RB Blake Corum, but Williams remains a borderline RB1/2 in what should be a fantasy-friendly game environment.</description>

      <title>Cardinals RB Emari Demercado (ankle) will not play in Arizona’s Week 14 game against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f06d-da9b-a9bf-fe6d44ea0000</link>
      <description>He had gone limited-limited over the first two days of the week, but Demercado popped up with a surprise DNP on Friday and was ruled out. That’s just normal Cardinals backfield stuff these days, as the world has conspired to give Zonovan Knight RB2/FLEX assignments. Arizona also named Xavier Weaver (hamstring) as questionable after he DNP’ed, a move that had Cardinals beat Darren Urban predicting a lot of Trent Sherfield on Sunday. So, you know, there are healthier teams in the league.</description>

      <title>Raiders coach Pete Carroll said he expects Maxx Crosby (knee) to play in Las Vegas’ Week 14 game against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f082-d005-a9bf-f8b6142e0000</link>
      <description>Crosby has not practiced in either of the last two sessions of the week and will likely get a questionable tag when the report drops later. As Vegas’ best (only?) good defensive player at this point, Crosby being ruled out would be big fantasy news for the Broncos’ prospects in Week 14.</description>

      <title>Raiders coach Pete Carroll said he expects TE Michael Mayer (ankle) to miss Week 14’s game against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f084-d77b-adfa-fa876e620000</link>
      <description>Carroll is “hopeful” that Mayer will play against the Eagles in Week 15. Fantasy managers have not been given a compelling reason to roster Mayer for the better part of the last month, and this latest rule out won’t help matters.</description>

      <title>Bears WR Rome Odunze “needs rest” after playing through a stress fracture in his foot and is now considered week-to-week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f088-d8cf-affb-fcaa7ffa0000</link>
      <description>Prior to the foot listing, Odunze had been a fixture on the Bears’ injury report with heel and ankle issues dating back to late October. It’s possible these listings are all related. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports that “the belief is it’s nothing long term and he’ll be back soon.” The Bears (9-3) sit atop the NFC standings. Preserving Odunze’s health for the playoffs makes sense. The Bears sandwich a Week 15 game against the Browns with games against the division-rival Packers in Weeks 14 and 16. Hopefully, Odunze is good to go for the rematch.</description>

      <title>Raiders ruled out WR Dont’e Thornton (concussion) for Week 14 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f092-d77b-adfa-fa933c960000</link>
      <description>Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said he expects rookie WR Jack Bech to be involved “a lot” in Week 14. Bech will likely play more snaps, but expecting him to be involved a lot as a receiver seems foolhardy. Thornton has earned just 25 targets all year and Bech somehow trails him with 14. Bech warrants mild DFS consideration but should not be in re-draft lineups.</description>

      <title>Bills claimed S Darnell Savage off waivers from the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f097-da9b-a9bf-fe9f0e130000</link>
      <description>The Bills placed CB Darius Slay on the reserve/did not report list earlier today, so Savage’s addition makes sense. Savage has played for both the Jaguars and Commanders this season, logging one pass breakup, 13 tackles and two quarterback pressures.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f097-da9b-a9bf-fe9f0e130000</guid>

      <title>Broncos WR Pat Bryant (hamstring) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 14 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f0a3-d005-a9bf-f8b7ed380000</link>
      <description>Bryant’s youthful hamstring is evidently good to go. The rookie wide receiver was added to Thursday’s injury report as a limited participant. He remained limited on Friday as well. The soft tissue injury adds volatility to his outlook, but he is a decent bet to earn a moderate single-digit target sum on Sunday.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f0a3-d005-a9bf-f8b7ed380000</guid>

      <title>Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer said WR CeeDee Lamb (concussion) “had a good day” on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f0f2-d005-a9bf-f8f6d1980000</link>
      <description>Lamb still has to get through the NFL’s concussion protocol, but this is nice to hear. Allowing the symptoms to abate through rest and rehab is key. Players frequently miss at least one game after entering the protocol, but the added rest time afforded to Lamb thanks to the Cowboys’ Week 14 Thursday Night Football game could help him take the field in Week 15 against the Vikings.</description>

      <title>Raiders QB Geno Smith (foot) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 14 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f11e-d005-a9bf-f93ee2bf0000</link>
      <description>Smith practiced fully on Thursday and Friday, which is a good sign. The error-prone quarterback cannot be started in single-quarterback leagues and is barely on the QB2 radar, given the tough matchup. Tight ends have had success against the Broncos this season, so hopefully, Smith locks onto TE Brock Bowers.</description>
