      <title>Broncos signed TE Marcedes Lewis from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-577f-d56e-afff-f7ff71460000</link>
      <description>Lewis is 41 years old, and probably will play forever. It will no longer come with any fantasy relevance, but it will be infinite.</description>

      <title>Kimani Vidal (neck) did not practice Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5781-d56e-afff-f7e9551b0000</link>
      <description>It’s an estimate with the team having Christmas Day off. Vidal did not practice at all this week, and the Chargers will take on the Texans on Saturday. It’s certainly possible Vidal will play, but it seems very unlikely, and very unwise to have him in a fantasy lineup regardless.</description>

      <title>George Kittle (ankle) was listed as a non-participant for Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5796-dc7a-af9b-dfbfdf990000</link>
      <description>Kittle has has now not participated in back-to-back practices ahead of the 49ers’ critical Week 17 game against the Bears. The tight end still has a chance to play, but Friday’s practice will be critical. Fantasy managers should be prepared for an alternative.</description>

      <title>Ricky Pearsall (ankle/knee) was listed as a limited participant for Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5799-d35e-a1bf-57db84ca0000</link>
      <description>It’s an estimate with the team not practicing on Christmas. Pearsall has been limited in back-to-back practices, and will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday Night Football against the Bears in Week 17.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5799-d35e-a1bf-57db84ca0000</guid>

      <title>Luther Burden was limited participant for Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-579a-d968-a19b-5ffbe99a0000</link>
      <description>Burden gets just an estimate since the Bears didn’t practice. The 22-year-old appears to be questionable for the Sunday Night showdown against the 49ers in Week 17.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-579a-d968-a19b-5ffbe99a0000</guid>

      <title>Rome Odunze (foot) was listed as a non-participant for Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-579c-d56e-afff-f7fcc57b0000</link>
      <description>Odunze will have one more potential pratice session Friday, but signs seem to be pointing to the 23-year-old missing antother football game against the 49ers in Week 17. Assuming he doesn’t play, Olamide Zaccheaus will likely be the second wideout option for that contest against San Francisco behind DJ Moore.</description>

      <title>Lamar Jackson (back) is listed as doubtful for Week 17 against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-57a1-d35e-a1bf-57e337310000</link>
      <description>Jackson was listed as a non-participant for Thursday’s practice before getting the doubtful designation. The 28-year-old almost assuredly will be out for Saturday’s game against the Packers, meaning Tyler Huntley will get the start in that contest. Whether Jackson plays in Week 18 against the Steelers will depend on how the signal-caller heels, and also if that game has any meaning.</description>

      <title>Jordan Love (concussion) is questionable to play in Week 17 against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-57a6-d56e-afff-f7ee4f020000</link>
      <description>Both Love and Malik Willis (shoulder/illness) are listed as questionable for the Saturday night showdown against Baltimore. Signs seem to be pointing for Love to be the starter for that contest after being a limited participant estimate Thursday, but he’ll need to clear the protocol before that can happen. There should be more clarification on this situation Friday, and fantasy managers who “need” to use either should be prepared for alternate paths.</description>

      <title>Malik Willis (shoulder/illness) was listed as a limited participant for Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-57ab-dc7a-af9b-dfbf21620000</link>
      <description>Willis is officially listed as questionable for Saturday’s Week 17 showdown against the Ravens. The 26-year-old picked up an illness that apparently has been making its way through the team before Wednesday’s practice on top of the shoulder issue he suffered at the end of the previous week’s overtime loss to the Bears. If Jordan Love (concussion) can’t go, Willis stands a decent chance to start against Baltimore on Saturday.</description>

      <title>Christian Watson (illness) is listed as questionable for Week 17 against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-57ae-d56e-afff-f7eef9a20000</link>
      <description>Watson was listed as a non-participant for Thursday’s practice ahead of the Saturday showdown with Baltimore. The wideout would be on the WR3 precipice if he can go, but fantasy managers obviously need to be prepared for a substitute.</description>
