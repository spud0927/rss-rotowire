      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Darnell Mooney is unlikely to miss any games after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 4’s win over the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-957a-d95b-addb-fd7e5b3b0000</link>
      <description>The injury that forced Mooney from Sunday’s game in the first half appears to be relatively minor. With the Falcons now entering their Week 5 bye, the hope is a week away will give him enough time to recover before returning in Week 6 to prepare for a Monday night matchup with the Bills. Mooney has gotten off to a slow start this season. He’s caught 7-of-16 targets for 79 scoreless yards, but remains the Falcons’ WR2 when active. We’ll have more of an update on his availability when the Falcons release their first injury report for Week 6.</description>

      <title>DeAndre Hopkins did not catch his lone target in the Ravens’ Week 4 loss against the Chiefs.</title>

      <description>Hopkins was invisible in this one, taking on more of a rotational role while Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman functioned as every-down players. With five receptions over four games, Hopkins is a fantasy non-factor that should remain on waiver wires. He won’t be fantasy viable unless Flowers and Bateman miss time.</description>

      <title>Texans traded OT Cam Robinson to the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-95f5-deb6-a7fd-d7ffcdae0000</link>
      <description>According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, the two teams will also swap late-round picks in 2027 to complete the deal. Robinson became expendable following the emergence of rookie second-rounder Aireontae Ersery, who has been locked in as the team’s starting left tackle since Week 2, while Robinson hasn’t played an offensive snap since Week 1. Robinson’s arrival in Cleveland gives them an immediate option to start at right tackle in place of Jack Conklin, who has missed three straight games, while also providing them with added depth at both tackle spots once Conklin returns.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes Lions CB D.J. Reed could be “a candidate for injured reserve” after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 4’s win over the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9604-dca3-a9fb-bf9d1df40000</link>
      <description>Reed was carted from the field in Week 4’s victory, and could end up missing at least four games if placed on injured reserve. A key piece of the Lions defense, Reed has already logged 212 defensive snaps through four weeks, per PFF, and has one interception and two pass breakups on his 2025 resumé. We’ll likely get more clarity on Reed’s injury later in the week, but his absence would be a serious loss for the Lions, who continue to battle injuries to their defense.</description>

      <title>Malik Nabers suffered a torn ACL in the Giants’ Week 4 win over the Chargers, ending his season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-960a-deb6-a7fd-d7dfd8ce0000</link>
      <description>The worst was confirmed early Monday morning, as Nabers, one of the league’s top talents at receiver, will now miss the rest of the season. Nabers is just the latest victim to fall victim to the turf at MetLife Stadium, as his season now ends with an 18-271-2 line on 35 targets. The second-year receiver was on an early place to replicate his rookie campaign numbers when he ripped off 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns on 109 receptions, and will be 23 at the start of next season. Assuming all goes well with his recovery, Nabers should remain a first-round draft pick in 2026 fantasy drafts and could be in line for a career year if Jaxson Dart pans out at quarterback.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes Lions CB Terrion Arnold’s Week 5 status could be at risk of missing Week 5’s game against the Bengals after suffering a shoulder injury in Week 4.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9606-deb6-a7fd-d7df36230000</link>
      <description>Arnold is one of two starting corners the Lions could be without in Week 5, as D.J. Reed also suffered a hamstring injury in Sunday’s victory and could be an IR candidate. Arnold has seemingly battled through one injury after another since entering the league last season as the No. 24 overall pick, but has been active for all four games this season. Arnold’s injury is not believed to be too serious, so if he were to miss time, he could just be looking at a one-game absence. His status will be one to monitor when injury reports are released on Wednesday.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports the Raiders believe OT Kolton Miller suffered a high-ankle sprain in Week 4’s loss to the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9615-d6e9-af9d-9e9521310000</link>
      <description>Miller will undergo an MRI to confirm, but Rapoport reports Miller could be looking at a “multi-week injury.” It’s brutal news for an offensive line that has performed like one of the worst in the league through the first four weeks of the season, and obviously affects both Geno Smith and Ashton Jeanty as far as fantasy is concerned. Miller could be a candidate for injured reserve if the MRI suggests the injury is severe enough to warrant a four-game absence or longer. Charles Grant, whom the Raiders drafted in the third round of this year’s draft, is listed behind Miller on the depth chart and would be in line to start in Miller’s absence.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan said Brock Purdy complained of soreness in his toe following Week 4’s loss to the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9652-dca3-a9fb-bfdb201d0000</link>
      <description>This isn’t all that surprising after Purdy missed two games due to a toe injury he suffered in Week 1. According to Shanahan, while speaking with Purdy on the phone after the game, Purdy “said (his toe) was starting to bother him,” but noted that he didn’t feel anything during the game. This remains a situation to watch heading into Week 5, especially with the Niners playing on a short week this Thursday. If he’s unable to go, Mac Jones would again be in line for the start against the Rams.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan said the team is hopeful Ricky Pearsall’s knee injury is a “minor PCL” issue.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9656-d95b-addb-fe5691400000</link>
      <description>“Hopefully it won’t be too bad,” Shanahan said while speaking to the media on Monday. Pearsall exited Week 4’s game against the Jaguars after landing hard on his knee, and said after the game that he felt some “instability” when he tested his knee to see if he could go back in. The 49ers have a short week to get ready for Week 5’s contest against the Rams on Thursday night. It could prove too short a time for Pearsall to get right in time to play, which could leave an already thin receiving corps with even fewer options in the passing game. Pearsall’s name will be one to watch when the team’s injury report is released on Monday.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan said the team is hopeful that safety Malik Mustapha can practice after Week 6.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-965a-dca3-a9fb-bfdb5f850000</link>
      <description>Mustapha landed on injured reserve last October with a torn ACL and has been working his way back ever since. The second-year player and former fourth-round pick started 12 of the 16 games he appeared in for the 49ers last season and totaled 72 tackles, two TFLs, and one interception in his rookie campaign. While he could return to practice after Week 6, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Niners take a few weeks to ramp him up before letting him return to game action.</description>
