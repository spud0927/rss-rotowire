      <title>Chris Olave caught 2-of-4 targets for 12 yards in the Saints’ preseason Week 2 game against the Jaguars.</title>

      <description>Olave was on the field for 18-of-18 first-team snaps with Tyler Shough, which is a great sign for his ankle health. His concussion history, coupled with the Saints’ questionable quarterback situation, enhances his risk, but fantasy managers are advised to continue drafting Olave as a high-upside seventh-round pick.</description>

      <title>Rashid Shaheed caught 3-of-3 targets for 15 yards in the Saints’ preseason Week 2 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba50-df63-a199-fb7bf0ac0000</link>
      <description>Shaheed played all 18 first-team reps alongside Tyler Shough and Chris Olave. He kicked inside, tying for a first-team-high seven snaps lined up in the slot. Adding quick-hitting layup routes from the slot will go a long way toward stabilizing Shaheed’s weekly scoring. His 13th-round PPR ADP makes for an easy click.</description>

      <title>Spencer Rattler completed 18-of-24 passes for 199 yards, one touchdown and one interception and rushed three times for 19 yards and one two-point conversion in the Saints’ preseason Week 2 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba67-d05a-adda-bae798c80000</link>
      <description>Rattler looked better than Tyler Shough did, though Rattler had the benefit of facing backups. The Saints are in an unenviable situation. Their rookie quarterback is failing to outplay their preferred backup. Fortunately, fantasy managers need not draft either player in re-draft formats.</description>

      <title>Kendre Miller rushed six times for 21 yards in the Saints’ preseason Week 2 game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba67-d05a-adda-bae75efa0000</link>
      <description>Miller played 5-of-5 snaps on the first drive, critically remaining on-field for third down. Ultimately, he and Cam Akers split first-team snaps 14-to-7, with Akers playing the remaining four third downs. Miller is astonishingly credited with five missed tackles forced. Akers rushed twice for two yards and caught 3-of-3 targets for 11 yards.</description>

      <title>Caleb Williams completed 6-of-10 passes for 107 yards and one touchdown in the Bears’ preseason Week 2 game against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-baab-d45c-a7fc-babb3aab0000</link>
      <description>Williams stood tall in the pocket and efficiently distributed the ball across his pass-catching corps. The Bills’ defense was mostly comprised of backups and rotational players, but it was a promising showing for a Bears offense that has received up-and-down reviews thus far.</description>

      <title>Jaguars acquired DT Khalen Saunders from the Saints in exchange for OL Luke Fortner.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bac5-d90d-a5bd-badf991b0000</link>
      <description>The trade curiously comes hours after the two teams played each other in preseason Week 2. The 29-year-old Saunders is entering his seventh NFL season, coming off a year in which he totaled 27 tackles, 14 quarterback pressures and two sacks. The Jaguars bolstered their interior defensive line by bringing aboard DT Arik Armstead and signing three undrafted free agent DTs this offseason.</description>

      <title>Colston Loveland caught 2-of-2 targets for 26 yards in the Bears’ preseason Week 2 game against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-baba-d90d-a5bd-bafbe4950000</link>
      <description>Caleb Williams targeted Loveland via play action on the first play from scrimmage, completing the pass for an eight-yard gain. Williams’ second target went to Cole Kmet for a 29-yard gain, marking Kmet’s lone target. Later, Williams found Loveland wide open on a post route, connecting for an 18-yard gain. Fantasy managers should expect both tight ends to remain involved in the regular season, particularly early on. Loveland has already established himself as a first-team contributor, though, which puts a TE1 finish within his range of outcomes. He looked great on his two opportunities.</description>

      <title>DJ Moore caught 2-of-2 targets for 16 yards in the Bears’ preseason Week 2 game against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bae8-d45c-a7fc-bafa87650000</link>
      <description>Moore connected with Caleb Williams on a third-and-five conversion, gaining 10 yards on an out route. It was a simple play but good to see the two players link up in crunch time. Moore must continue developing his relationship with Williams after a bumpy first season together.</description>

      <title>Rome Odunze caught 0-of-1 targets in the Bears’ preseason Week 2 game against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ba9f-d05a-adda-ba9ffc190000</link>
      <description>Odunze dropped his lone target against the Bills. He got open on a third-and-five curl route but was unable to secure it as he dove toward the sideline to make the catch. The first-team offense was then done for the day. Hopefully, the starters take the field again next week, allowing Odunze and Caleb Williams to get on the same page against a live NFL defense before Week 1.</description>

      <title>Olamide Zaccheaus caught 1-of-2 targets for 36 yards and one touchdown in the Bears’ preseason game against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-baf0-d05a-adda-baf24b180000</link>
      <description>Caleb Williams spotted Zaccheaus open in the shallows and hit him in stride as he scooted past the first-down marker. Zaccheaus was off to the races after that, shedding an ankle-grab as he snaked downfield. Zaccheaus is beginning to look like he may warrant a few WR5/flex starts against soft defenses early in the year. He has Williams’ trust. The coaching staff will undoubtedly give Luther Burden opportunities to take the WR3 job from him, so Zaccheaus’ fantasy relevance could dry up rapidly, but for now, Zaccheaus appears to be on track for WR3 duties in Week 1.</description>
