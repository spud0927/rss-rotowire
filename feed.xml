      <title>Vikings LG Donovan Jackson (wrist) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a0f5-deb6-a7fd-f3ffa71f0000</link>
      <description>Jackson missed Week 4 with the wrist injury and will likely remain sideliend for the Vikings’ upcoming matchup with the Browns. Center Ryan Kelly suffered a concussion in Week 4 and right tackle Brian O’Neill went down with a knee injury. Neither player practiced on Wednesday. Carson Wentz is set to face the Browns without three of his starting offensive linemen.</description>

      <title>Giants coach Brian Daboll said Jaxson Dart (hamstring) won’t be limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a0f9-d95b-addb-e8ff878d0000</link>
      <description>Dart left Week 4’s win over the Chargers for a concussion evaluation and also suffered a hamstring injury. He returned after a brief check from the medical staff. While Dart needs to do a better job of protecting his body, he appears to be fine after a rollercoaster of an NFL debut. His rushing output will keep him in the QB2 ranks for Week 5 versus the Saints.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Dan Graziano reports that Chiefs RB Brashard Smith is expected to have “more involvement in the offense” moving forward.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a0f9-d95b-addb-e8ff9df20000</link>
      <description>Smith logged 19 offensive snaps last week, hitting the double-digit mark for the first time this season. He likewise hit season highs in carries (four) and targets (four). Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt are playing very inefficiently and Smith’s pass-catching profile fits well with the Chiefs’ preferred offensive approach. His chance to establish himself as the Chiefs’ committee leader, or more, appears to be upon us. Seventh-round rookies cannot be viewed as guaranteed to succeed, but he is absolutely worth adding wherever available right now, before we find out if Smith has what it takes.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports that the Browns are “really excited” about WR Isaiah Bond, TE Harold Fannin Jr. and RB Quinshon Judkins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a10f-d95b-addb-e94fa0b20000</link>
      <description>Bond is set to assume a larger role in the offense with WR Cedric Tillman (hamstring) landing on injured reserve this week. Bond posted season highs in routes (27), targets (six), receptions (three) and yards (58) last week. He is tough to trust against the Vikings in rookie QB Dillon Gabriel’s first start, but he should be stashed by wide receiver-needy managers. ESPN’s Dan Graziano adds that Fannin’s “usage will only expand” as the season progresses.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler said he gets the “sense” that Anthony Richardson “would be open to joining a premier playcaller such as Sean McVay as a developmental player so he can reset for 2026.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a10e-dca3-a9fb-bd9f70af0000</link>
      <description>Richardson’s theoretical reset might take a little longer than that, but this is an intriguing scenario. ESPN’s Dan Graziano chimed in to say that he remembers “a couple of teams wondering whether Indy would be open to moving him during free agency.” Matthew Stafford began the year with worrying back problems, entering his age-37 season. He, of course, now ranks top three in passing yards (1,114) and touchdowns (eight), so there is no immediate need in Los Angeles and Fowler did not actually say that the Rams are interested in Richardson. Bringing aboard a high-upside prospect simply makes sense for teams possessing this type of player and coaching staff infrastructure. Stay tuned.</description>

      <title>Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said EDGE DeMarcus Lawrence (thigh) is considered “day to day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a0fd-deb6-a7fd-f3ffe24e0000</link>
      <description>Macdonald said he doesn’t know if Lawrence will suit up for Week 5, but he did note that Lawrence will not be placed on injured reserve, meaning he is expected to miss fewer than four games. The long-time Cowboy joined the Seahawks on a three-year deal this offseason. Lawrence wasn’t playing every down, but he was soaking up roughly two-thirds of the defensive snaps before going down in Week 4. Per Pro Football Focus, Lawrence has seven stops and eight pressures this year.</description>

      <title>Cam Skattebo (knee) is practicing in full for Week 5 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a143-d6e9-af9d-abd3e59d0000</link>
      <description>Skattebo is undoubtedly a bit sore after touching the ball 27 times on Sunday, but a full practice means he is good to go for Week 5. Tyrone Tracy is out for at least one more week, leaving the bulk of the backfield touches to the rookie. Facing an 0-4 Saints squad, the Giants should be able to establish a ground-heavy approach this week. That, of course, means another hefty workload for Skattebo, who is a high-end RB2 for Week 5.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports that, “while Cooper Kupp seems entrenched as Seattle’s WR2, [Tory] Horton is giving the Seahawks something to think about.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a142-dca3-a9fb-bddbd0dc0000</link>
      <description>Fowler notes that Horton “has six catches on 10 targets for 74 yards and two touchdowns” and scored a third touchdown on a franchise-best 95-yard punt return. Kupp has been held under 35 receiving yards in 3-of-4 games despite leading the Seahawks’ wide receiver corps with 171 offensive snaps. The fifth-round rookie could see increased opportunities in the coming weeks, though unseating Kupp, who the front office signed to a three-year, $45 million contract this offseason, will not be easy. Horton warrants a spot on fantasy benches at this time.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Dan Graziano said it sounds like Terry McLaurin “could need another week or two to heal from his quad injury.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a14c-d6e9-af9d-abdcbdc30000</link>
      <description>Graziano adds that “the Commanders will know more as the practice week goes along.” Fantasy managers should prepare for McLaurin to sit out in Week 5, if not Week 6. The Commanders are handling this injury with patience, which is an overall good sign for McLaurin’s availability down the stretch. The coaching staff reportedly plans to continue using rookie WR Jaylin Lane in the slot and WR Deebo Samuel out wide while McLaurin is out. Samuel is expected to revert to frequent slot usage once the receiving corps returns to full health, but Lane is at least getting the opportunity to make his mark.</description>

      <title>Alec Pierce (concussion) is practicing in full for Week 5 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-a150-d95b-addb-e956ad0a0000</link>
      <description>A full practice means Pierce is nearly out of the league’s concussion protocol. He should have no issues getting cleared before the weekend. His return will send Adonai Mitchell back to the bench. Mitchell committed the blunder of the week on Sunday when the ball slipped out of his hands just as he was about to cross the goal line for a long touchdown. He was also called for a holding penalty on a 58-yard Jonathan Taylor touchdown. This will likely be the last we hear from Mitchell for a while.</description>
