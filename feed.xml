      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if Commanders general manager Adam Peters is “active” this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-595a-d355-a5bd-df5eb74f0000</link>
      <description>Per Over The Cap, the Commanders currently have the fifth-most salary cap space with more than $75.4 million available in 2026. Rapoport notes that general manager Adam Peters has been an active trader in recent seasons. Regarding free agency, Rapoport adds that “with a good, young quarterback, the time to spend is now.”</description>

      <title>Chargers hired Sean Spence to their defensive staff.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5972-d355-a5bd-df767d6a0000</link>
      <description>Spence is expected to serve as the Chargers’ new inside linebackers coach, though the role has not yet been finalized. The former NFL linebacker (2012-2017) began his coaching career as a special teams analyst at Western Michigan in 2023. He coached linebackers for them in 2024 and edges in 2025.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports that the Jaguars “plan to play” Travis Hunter as a full-time cornerback and part-time wide receiver in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5998-d355-a5bd-dfdcf3cf0000</link>
      <description>Per Wolfe, the Jaguars believe Hunter can be an “elite” cornerback, while still being “an impact player” on offense. For fantasy purposes, this is unfortunate. Hunter may be stuck rotating in as a contributor in three-wide receiver sets, which would make him frustratingly unreliable, though head coach Liam Coen will likely try to scheme up ways to get the ball in his hands. On the plus side, Wolfe said Hunter will be “full-go” by Week 1. The Jaguars are reportedly expected to let one of their free agent cornerbacks, Montaric Brown or Greg Newsome, walk in free agency.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports that the Colts could “be aggressive” in their pursuit of Bengals EDGE Trey Hendrickson via a tag-and-trade scenario or free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-59de-d355-a5bd-dfdeccbb0000</link>
      <description>Bengals DC Lou Anarumo and DL coach Marion Hobby both coached Hendrickson, in the exact same roles, when all three were employed by the Bengals for four-plus seasons. Hendrickson’s relationship with the Bengals has soured, though the front office has thus far been unwilling to let the talented pass rusher leave town. This will be worth watching. Stay tuned.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe said “don’t be surprised” if the Browns do not draft a quarterback in the first round.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-592e-d629-a1bc-f93fa00e0000</link>
      <description>The Browns have two first-round picks this year. Wolfe reports that the Browns believe they are “close to set” on defense and are expected to “go heavy on offense” in the 2026 NFL Draft. New head coach Todd Monken’s scheme is said to have more “flexibility” than former head coach Kevin Stefanski’s scheme did, and the Browns apparently believe Monken’s scheme could allow Shedeur Sanders to “use his play-making ability” more effectively. The Browns also “believe” Deshaun Watson will compete with Sanders for the starting role.</description>

      <title>Raiders interviewed Packers DL coach/run game coordinator DeMarcus Covington for their vacant defensive coordinator position.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5d67-d042-afbc-7df735b80000</link>
      <description>The Raiders pounced on their top choice at head coach immediately following the Super Bowl with the hiring of former Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak but they have yet to fill any of their coordinator positions. Covington has drawn multiple interviews for defensive coordinator vacancies this hiring cycle but did not land his first play-calling gig, with the Raiders now an additional opportunity to do just that.</description>

      <title>Raiders promoted former run game coordinator/defensive line coach Rob Leonard to defensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5da6-d629-a1bc-fdbf0df50000</link>
      <description>Leonard previously spent six seasons with the Giants before coaching with the Raiders under Patrick Graham last year. The Raiders conducted their fair share of interviews for the vacant defensive coordinator position before promoting from within. Leonard worked closely with Pro Bowl defensive lineman Maxx Crosby, potentially marking a play at retaining the veteran rusher this offseason.</description>
