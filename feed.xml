      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Browns are expected to move on from head coach Kevin Stefanski.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89df-d968-a19b-d9ffa3fa0000</link>
      <description>It sounds like Stefanski still has a chance to be a head coach next year and that he’ll be one of the hot names of the cycle given the relative dearth of offensive-focused coaching candidates. There has been some discussion that Stefanski could be a trade candidate, and Schefter saying that they’ll “move on” from Stefanski rather than firing him perhaps lends some credence to that thought. Either way, Stefanski is likely coaching his last game for the Browns today.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Ravens head coach John Harbaugh is uncertain to return in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89e2-d35e-a1bf-cde2a1c40000</link>
      <description>Schefter said Harbaugh’s job security is very much “up in the air.” Harbaugh and Ravens ownership are expected to meet in the coming weeks, following Harbaugh’s 18th NFL season at the helm in Baltimore, the second longest current head coaching tenure behind Mike Tomlin. Schefter said he would expect Harbaugh to be back as head coach in 2026 despite the team’s uneven performance in recent seasons and what appears to be a difficult relationship with Lamar Jackson, who has struggled mightily throughout 2025. If Harbaugh were to leave Baltimore, he would have his choice of another NFL head coaching position.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “people feel like” Falcons coach Raheem Morris “may have saved his job.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89e3-dc7a-af9b-cfff44180000</link>
      <description>We aren’t entirely sure who these “people” are, but Schefter knows as many people as any reporter around the league. That’s why we believe him when he says Morris is leaning safe, but that GM Terry Fontenot is on a hotter seat. Players love to play for Morris, but Fontenot’s huge front-office gambles have mostly fallen flat, none more so than last year’s shock selection of Michael Penix. We could still see Atlanta keeping the entire band together, but that seems unlikely at this point. Even Morris could still end up being let go depending on how this week’s exit meetings go.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “the belief around the league” is that the Raiders will “move on” from head coach Pete Carroll.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89e5-d968-a19b-d9f580970000</link>
      <description>The smoke on Carroll’s impending firing has been out of control all week, with the embattled 74-year-old head coach being a consensus pick to lose his job following today’s game against the Chiefs. The Raiders will have to eat the final two years of Carroll’s contract to fire him. The Raiders definitely haven’t done enough to give Carroll any benefit of the doubt, but it’s still a little surprising that the Raiders will become the first team to one-and-done consecutive coaches since the 2021-22 Houston Texans.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “there is a feeling from many” that Mike Tomlin will remain the Steelers’ head coach through 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89de-d35e-a1bf-cdde39160000</link>
      <description>Tomlin is under contract for one more season. The Steelers haven’t fired a head coach since the 1968 season, and they aren’t likely to break that streak with Tomlin, the league’s longest-tenured boss. Pittsburgh faces Baltimore tonight with the AFC North crown on the line. Fans and pundits will call for Tomlin to be fired if they lose, but we suspect the organization will let him see the end of his contract even if the Steelers miss the postseason. Then Tomlin will have a prove-it year with the team in 2026. He is all but guaranteed his job for next year if Tomlin and the Steelers topple Baltimore tonight.</description>

      <title>Vikings declared RB Aaron Jones, WR Myles Price, QB John Wolford, CB Dwight McGlothern Jr., QB Brett Rypien Sr., T Walter Rouse, and TE T.J. Hockenson inactive for Week 18 against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89e8-d56e-afff-efe8cbed0000</link>
      <description>Facing defensive backups for the Packers, Jordan Mason will likely get a starter’s workload in the Minnesota backfield with Jones sidelined. JJ McCarthy, dealing with a hand injury, will start the regular season’s final game. Look for Justin Jefferson to be peppered with targets as QB-WR combo try to get on the same page ahead of an uncertain offseason for McCarthy.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the “feeling around the league” is that Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon’s job is “safe.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89ea-d56e-afff-efea1f2e0000</link>
      <description>We’re not sure what else Gannon would have to do to lose his job at this point. They’ve reeled off eight straight losses to fall to 3-13 and will face a motivated Rams team today to likely fall to 3-14. Despite massive monetary investments in their defense this offseason, the former Eagles defensive coordinator Gannon has the Cardinals 27th in defensive DVOA. They’ve allowed 40 points four different times during their losing streak, and allowed 37 to the Bengals in Week 17 before they mercifully pulled Joe Burrow. Despite these results, Gannon is apparently viewed as safe.</description>

      <title>Cowboys declared LB DeMarvion Overshown, CB Shavon Revel Jr., S Alijah Clark, DT Jay Toia, and DT Perrion Winfrey inactive for Week 18 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89ef-dc7a-af9b-cfff2f990000</link>
      <description>Clark is inactive for personal reasons, but the rest of the inactives are not a surprise. This will end the season for all five defenders.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “the feeling ultimately around the league” is that Shane Steichen will remain the Colts’ head coach for 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-89e7-d35e-a1bf-cde7f20e0000</link>
      <description>Per Schefter, the same is true of GM Chris Ballard. It’s never entirely fair to blame a single injury for a team’s struggles, but the Colts were the AFC’s No. 1 seed when Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury. Even with Jones’ play dropping off in the second half of the season, he was still doing enough to keep the team in the playoff mix. The Colts would almost certainly be competing for the AFC South title this week had Jones stayed healthy. After watching Steichen turn around Jones’ career en route to an 8-4 record before his injury, there was no way the team could move on from him at the end of the season. The Colts will now be tasked with bringing Jones, an impending free agent, back on a deal that works for both sides. The 2026 season will likely tie together the fates of Steichen, Irsay, and Jones.</description>
