      <title>Cowboys blocked the Eagles’ requests to interview offensive coordinator Klayton Adams for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f636-d56e-afff-f6fe1a850000</link>
      <description>It would be a lateral move for Adams, so the Cowboys are allowed to block the interview and keep him in Dallas. Adams joined the Cowboys in 2025 after spending a few years as the Cardinals’ offensive line coach. Dallas erupted this year, finishing seventh in points per game and second in yards per game. Javonte Williams and George Pickens both had career years while Dak Prescott bounced back after a down 2024 campaign. Adams will be back with the team next year, though another elite showing from the offense could get him head coaching interviews next offseason.</description>

      <title>Patriots declared LB Harold Landry, CB Kobee Minor, OT Marcus Bryant, OG Caedan Wallace, TE C.J. Dippre, WR Efton Chism, and QB Tommy DeVito inactive for Sunday’s AFC Championship Game against the Broncos.</title>

      <description>The Patriots enter Sunday against the Broncos in relatively good shape. Landry was ruled out before the weekend, but the team does have Mack Hollins returning for his first game since Week 16 against the Ravens, giving Drake Maye an added element in the passing game.</description>

      <title>Troy Franklin (hamstring) is inactive for Sunday’s AFC Championship Game against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f66f-d35e-a1bf-f7ef6e780000</link>
      <description>Franklin was limited in practice all week after injuring his hamstring in last week’s Divisional Round win over the Bills. The second-year receiver hasn’t seen many targets when active as of late, and the return of Pat Bryant gives the Broncos another weapon in the passing game. In addition to Franklin the Broncos also declared S JL Skinner, LB Karene Reid, C Alex Forsyth, WR Michael Bandy, DL Jordan Jackson, and DE Sai’vion Jones inactive for Sunday’s game.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes “it is likely” former Bills HC Sean McDermott takes a year off from coaching.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f67c-d56e-afff-f6fc3a760000</link>
      <description>As Rapoport notes in his report, McDermott has not engaged with any coaching openings across the league, a signal that he could temporarily step away. Rap also adds that McDermott has spoken to other coaches who have taken a year away, who said the time off was “beneficial and worth it.” We’re less than a week removed from McDermott’s firing after the Bills lost to the Broncos in the Divisional Round, so it’s still possible he considers some openings, even as a defensive coordinator, once jobs continue to fill. That said, the fact he hasn’t spoken with any teams yet regarding their vacancies is certainly noteworthy.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports former Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel is “still in the mix” for the Raiders’ head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f6ab-d968-a19b-fefbb6a10000</link>
      <description>According to Rapoport, McDaniel is ultimately expected to take the Chargers’ offensive coordinator role, but until the Raiders officially rule him out as a candidate, he will remain an option for the Silver and Black. McDaniel most recently canceled his interview with the Bills on Friday and withdrew his name for consideration for the Browns before that. McDaniel has made several rounds this coaching cycle to speak with teams, but the Chargers seem like the most likely fit barring a team sweeps in and hands him a head coaching gig.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports Steelers HC Mike McCarthy “liked Will Howard a lot” as a QB prospect in last year’s draft.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f6b5-d56e-afff-f6fd168a0000</link>
      <description>It’s hard to know how seriously to take these nuggets in January, especially when Howard is one of only two quarterbacks currently under contract with the Steelers. Howard was selected by the Steelers in the sixth round of last year’s draft and threw for 4,010-35-10 in his final college season with Ohio State on his way to winning a national championship. Given the current state of the Steelers’ quarterback room and the uncertainty surrounding Aaron Rodgers, it’s possible Howard gets a chance to compete for the starting job in camp, but the Steelers are all but certain to add another quarterback or two to their room this offseason, whether it’s via the draft or free agency.</description>

      <title>Bills completed an interview with Jaguars OC Grant Udinski for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f6bb-d56e-afff-f6fbaecd0000</link>
      <description>The 30-year-old Udinski remains one of the hottest names this coaching cycle after he helped lead the Jaguars to the sixth-most points scored and 11th-most offensive yards in his first season. Before joining the Jaguars, Udinski spent three seasons with the Vikings under head coach Kevin O’Connell. If he were to land a head-coaching job, Udinski would become the youngest head coach in NFL history.</description>

      <title>Giants hired former Ravens special teams coordinator Chris Horton to the same position.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f6e5-d35e-a1bf-f7e7330e0000</link>
      <description>Earlier this month, the Ravens blocked Horton from making a lateral move to another organization. Now, the 12th-year NFL coach will join John Harbaugh in New York as the Giants’ new special teams coordinator, meaning new Ravens head coach Jesse Minter will have another staff member to add in the coming days.</description>

      <title>Broncos WR Pat Bryant (hamstring) is questionable to return Sunday against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f6fb-dc7a-af9b-ffffb1a10000</link>
      <description>Bryant suffered a hamstring injury on the Broncos’ opening drive. After attempting to play through it, the rookie receiver is now on the sideline and is questionable to return. Bryant caught one pass for two yards before his injury.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f6fb-dc7a-af9b-ffffb1a10000</guid>

      <title>Giants hired former Titans DC Dennard Wilson to the same position.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f706-dc7a-af9b-ffbf20c40000</link>
      <description>Wilson served under John Harbaugh in 2023 as the Ravens’ defensive backs coach. The veteran coach was hired as the Titans’ defensive coordinator in 2024 and saw his defenses ranked 28th and 30th in points allowed during his two years with the team. With that in mind, Wilson didn’t have much to work with in Tennessee, which finished as the worst team in football in his first season with the team, and didn’t fare much better this year. He’ll get a chance at a fresh restart with the Giants, who are better set up for success entering next season.</description>
