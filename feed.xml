      <title>Ravens WR Rashod Bateman (ankle) practiced in full on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcb3-d90e-a9da-bfbf17f20000</link>
      <description>The Ravens look likely to get their starting outside receiver back against the Bengals on Thanksgiving. There’s no reason to full send a Bateman recommendation with all 32 teams playing in Week 13, but if you’re in a deep enough league to consider it, a matchup against the league-worst Bengals defense certainly would be an understandable circumstance to start Bateman into.</description>

      <title>NFL suspended Panthers S Tre’Von Moehrig one game for punching 49ers WR Jauan Jennings in the groin on Monday night.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcb9-d90e-a9da-bfbf5eb50000</link>
      <description>It will undoubtedly be appealed, but as Ja’Marr Chase learned last week, it’s hard to “get away” with something like this when there are thousands of cameras trained on every football field. Assuming it sticks, Moehrig will miss Week 13’s game against the Rams.</description>

      <title>Saints signed RB Evan Hull to their active roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcdd-d6c4-abfb-fedfc6940000</link>
      <description>He’ll join Devin Neal and Audric Estime in the derby to see who can replace Alvin Kamara’s weekly 27-40 rushing yards. Hull was a fifth-round pick by the Colts in 2023 and has one NFL carry to his name.</description>

      <title>Panthers coach Dave Canales said CB Corey Thornton (fibula) is out for the remainder of the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bce0-d6c4-abfb-fee355bf0000</link>
      <description>He broke his fibula against the 49ers in Week 12’s Monday night game. The 2025 UDFA had been decent in spot duty for the Panthers, notching a 67.6 PFF coverage grade in 127 defensive snaps.</description>

      <title>Bills signed WR Brandin Cooks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bce4-db57-afda-fef605710000</link>
      <description>Cooks has just 1,081 yards over his last 36 games and will need to prove to us that he’ll be a fantasy factor before we recommend adding him in anything but the deepest leagues. He did have a lower-rung role with the Saints early in the season, with 15 targets in his first four weeks, but his work eventually dwindled. It’s a big-name add, but not necessarily one that shakes up the fantasy landscape.</description>

      <title>Cowboys WR KaVontae Turpin (shoulder/illness) was limited in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcef-d90e-a9da-bfef26380000</link>
      <description>Turpin was a DNP on Monday. The shifty slot receiver/returner looks to be trending towards playing on a short week after taking three touches for a combined 52 yards on Sunday afternoon.</description>

      <title>Chiefs TE Noah Gray (concussion) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcf0-d82c-a79a-bff4bf410000</link>
      <description>Gray has slowly seen his role in the passing game grow over the past month, accumulating 12 targets in Kansas City’s last four games. It looks very unlikely he’ll be up for Thursday’s game against the Cowboys.</description>

      <title>Chiefs G Trey Smith (ankle) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcf3-d82c-a79a-bff7167f0000</link>
      <description>Back-to-back DNPs have the star guard looking unlikely to play against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. He’s reportedly dealing with both “high- and low-ankle sprains,” per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. It wouldn’t be surprising if he missed multiple weeks.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcf3-d82c-a79a-bff7167f0000</guid>

      <title>Chiefs WR Xavier Worthy (ankle) participated in full during Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcf4-db57-afda-fef6a9410000</link>
      <description>If you were ever going to start Worthy again, you’d have to figure it would be against the Cowboys, right? But they’ve improved enough on defense over the last few games that Worthy is probably still just a questionable FLEX play in Week 13 with no teams on bye. Worthy upgraded from a limited practice on Monday and continues to have his ankle injury managed.</description>

      <title>Bears LB T.J. Edwards (hand/hamstring) did not practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bd03-db57-afda-ff33ebac0000</link>
      <description>Neither did Ruben Hyppolite (shoulder), LB Noah Sewell (elbow), or CB Tyrique Stevenson (hip) on the estimated report. The good news is that Kyler Gordon and Jaylon Johnson, both on IR, practiced in full on Tuesday. Still, down several linebackers, this could be a smash spot for the struggling Saquon Barkley on Black Friday.</description>
