      <title>Chargers LB Daiyan Henley (illness) is questionable for Los Angeles’ Week 3 game against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-63b8-d6a5-adff-f7fd7b230000</link>
      <description>It’s kind of surprising that the illness has lasted this long — Henley drew another DNP in practice on Friday after also missing Wednesday — and even despite him playing through it on Monday Night it’s certainly possible he sits this game out.</description>

      <title>Broncos ruled out TE Evan Engram (back) for Week 3 against the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-63b3-d1b3-a5dd-63f3a6210000</link>
      <description>Like many 31-year-olds, Engram’s back is aching. Unfortunately for him, Engram plays professional football and is also coming off a calf injury. He was completely unable to practice this week, as was LB Dre Greenlaw (quad). At some point, Engram may regain his health and allow us to fully measure how much talent he has left in the tank, but for now, Engram can be dropped if an injured tight end like Dallas Goedert or Isaiah Likely is available.</description>

      <title>49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said Brock Purdy (toe/left shoulder) is “highly unlikely” to start despite being questionable to play in Week 3 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-63c0-d6a5-adff-f7c530640000</link>
      <description>Tomorrow, the team will see how Purdy is feeling, to determine if he can be the No. 2 or emergency No. 3 quarterback. Fantasy managers who are in desperate need of a QB2 with moderate upside should have Mac Jones at their disposal. The pocket passer completed 26-of-39 passes for 279 yards and three touchdowns and rushed six times for six yards against the Saints last week. He also fumbled twice.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (ankle/shoulder) is questionable to play in Week 3 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-63db-d1b3-a5dd-63fb56bf0000</link>
      <description>Jennings did not participate in Friday’s practice. Instead, he worked off to the side during the portion of practice open to the media. The 28-year-old veteran does not necessarily need to practice in order to play, but his inability to do so is concerning. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan typically lets his injured players take their normal allotment of snaps on game day, for good or ill. Given that, Jennings’ ceiling remains intact, but he would obviously be at risk of an in-game setback. He makes for a risky WR3/FLEX option if he is active on Sunday.</description>

      <title>49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said WR Jordan Watkins (calf) is a candidate for injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-63b3-d93f-ad9d-7bf7a07d0000</link>
      <description>Watkins is expected to miss three or four weeks after injuring his calf on Thursday. The rookie wide receiver cannot catch a break. He was considered a candidate to assume Nos. 3 or 4 wide receivers duties at one point in training camp, but his progress was derailed by an ankle injury. Having successfully rehabbed that, he is unfortunately now dealing with a new issue.</description>

      <title>Cardinals CB Will Johnson (groin) is doubtful for Week 3 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-63f3-dfde-a1bd-7fffd79a0000</link>
      <description>Johnson’s teammate, CB Max Melton, is questionable to play with a knee injury. He was limited in practice all week. Johnson was completely unable to participate. Injuries are never good, but the Cardinals may be catching a break this week, facing the Mac Jones-led 49ers. Jones is without George Kittle (hamstring), and Jauan Jennings (ankle/shoulder) is questionable to play despite failing to practice.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said Jordan Mason is going to be used “a lot” in the Vikings’ Week 3 game against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-646e-dfde-a1bd-7eef844c0000</link>
      <description>The Vikings are expected to be without both J.J. McCarthy (ankle) and Aaron Jones (hamstring) for multiple games. McCarthy’s return timeline sits in the two-to-four week range while Jones must miss at least four games on injured reserve. Earlier this week, Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell expressed “confidence” in utilizing Mason as a “potential bellcow.” Unfortunately, C Ryan Kelly (concussion) and backup LT Justin Skule (concussion) are out for Week 3. LT Christian Darrisaw (knee) is questionable. Still, Mason is a volume-based, high-end RB2.</description>

      <title>Chiefs WR Xavier Worthy (shoulder) is ruled out for Week 3 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-67c0-d93f-ad9d-7fc7b1890000</link>
      <description>Worthy missed Week 2 after dislocating his shoulder in a collision with Travis Kelce in the season opener. The 22-year-old wide receiver had three limited practices this week, but he’s been ruled out against the Giants. Kelce, Tyquan Thornton and Hollywood Brown led the Chiefs receiving group with Worthy sidelined a week ago and figure to do the same in Week 3.</description>

      <title>Colts TE Tyler Warren (toe) was removed from the injury for Week 3 against the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-67d7-d93f-ad9d-7fd7fb100000</link>
      <description>Warren’s toe prevented him from getting in a full practice all week. The 23-year-old tight end missed practice Wednesday before finishing the week with two limited practice sessions. That Warren has been removed from the injury report is bullish for the rookie from Penn State and he should be starting in all formats against the Titans.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Buccaneers WR Emeka Egbuka (hip/groin) is expected to play in Week 3 against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-67fe-dfde-a1bd-7fff990c0000</link>
      <description>Despite only getting in one limited practice this week, Egbuka is expected to be available for the Buccaneers according to Fowler. The 22-year-old receiver has been everything the Buccaneers could have hoped for with three touchdowns and 96 yards in his first two games. Egbuka is a WR2 going up against the Jets in Week 3.</description>
