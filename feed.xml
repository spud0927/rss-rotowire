      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports that the Patriots are “ecstatic” over rookie RB TreVeyon Henderson, “so don’t be surprised if he turns into their lead option.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f812-dbe3-a9bb-f853c3d20000</link>
      <description>Earlier this week, Howe’s colleague, Chad Graff, said he believes Henderson could get half of the Patriots’ backfield carries or more. The explosive rookie is already a good bet to handle passing down duties. Becoming the lead rusher could make returning value on his late-fourth-round ADP a non-issue. Henderson can be viewed as an RB2 with RB1 upside, who will likely command larger touch counts as the season progresses.</description>

      <title>Patriots WR Kayshon Boutte has had a “stunning” offseason turnaround</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f81f-db7b-a5dd-f81f83330000</link>
      <description>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe lists Boutte alongside Stefon Diggs and DeMario Douglas as the three Patriots wide receivers who have had good training camps. The report is in line with observations shared by ESPN’s Mike Reiss earlier this month. Boutte seems to have secured the No. 3 wide receiver role. He has long odds of returning flex value reliably but he is a name to know for deep league, late-round dart throws.</description>

      <title>Patriots CB Christian Gonzalez’s hamstring injury has been “tricky” and the timetable on his return is “tough to pin down.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f824-d332-a1fd-fe36dd0e0000</link>
      <description>Gonzalez strained his hamstring on July 28th and reports initially indicated his Week 1 availability had not been jeopardized. His status for the Patriots’ opening game against the Raiders is now uncertain. The Patriots notably face the Dolphins and their speedy wideouts in Week 2.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports Chargers DC Jesse Minter and Packers DC Jeff Hafley could be head coaching candidates in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f820-db7b-a5dd-f82448570000</link>
      <description>Not all ownership groups are sold on the idea of hiring an offensive-minded head coach, though the approach certainly reduces the expected turnover rate when fielding a successful offense. For those interested in an old school approach, Howe believes teams in search of a “defense-minded approach” will be doing their homework on Minter and Hafley.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe believes that it “might not be all that shocking” if rookie WR Matthew Golden “quickly” becomes Jordan Love’s “go-to wide receiver.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f840-db7b-a5dd-f84426610000</link>
      <description>Golden punctuated his “tremendous camp” by starting alongside Romeo Doubs in the Packers’ third preseason game. With Christian Watson (knee) out for at least four games on the reserve/physically unable to perform list and Jayden Reed (foot) rehabbing a Jones fracture, Golden’s path to No. 1 pass-catcher duties is clear. Rookies sometimes develop slowly but Golden might be able to hit the ground running as a WR4 with upside.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports that Kyle Pitts could be a trade candidate “if the Falcons stumble before the Nov. 5 deadline.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f858-db7b-a5dd-f85c1e030000</link>
      <description>Per Howe, “teams have been under the impression Pitts could have been available in a trade in the past.” He enters the fifth and final year of his rookie contract and is set to earn a $10.878 million salary. Howe believes that the financial aspect would be “the obstacle” in a potential trade, but teams are sometimes willing to eat a portion of a player’s salary if they are simply seeking future draft capital. If Pitts and Michael Penix Jr. form a strong bond, and that bond yields wins, this could all be moot. He’s a back-end TE1 with upside, entering 2025.</description>

      <title>Micah Parsons (back tightness) said he’s feeling “great” and that he won’t be sitting “on the sideline” for the Packers’ Week 1 game against the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f844-dbe3-a9bb-f857ef820000</link>
      <description>Parsons assured Packers fans that he will be available for Week 1, saying he knows that the team “didn’t give up what they gave up for me to sit on the sideline.” It’s good to know his rehab program has cured him of that dreaded ailment. The Packers’ D/ST looks like one of fantasy football’s best, but they face stiff tests against the Lions and Commanders to open the season.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe believes Seahawks S “Nick Emmanwori should be considered a dark-horse candidate to win NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f861-db7b-a5dd-f865fa790000</link>
      <description>Emmanwori “has been a playmaking force in practice,” and will “eventually” take on a similar role as the one Ravens S Kyle Hamilton played in head coach Mike Macdonald’s scheme when he served as the defensive coordinator in Baltimore. Howe believes “Macdonald’s defense should be even better in his second season.” It’s squarely on the D/ST1 radar.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f861-db7b-a5dd-f865fa790000</guid>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports that the Seahawks’ offense “seems to be quickly coming together with a more unified vision” under new OC Klint Kubiak.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f86a-d332-a1fd-fe7eca850000</link>
      <description>Kubiak is expected to feature a zone rushing attack while confusing defenses with motion and attacking downfield via play-action. No. 2 RB Zach Charbonnet had a great training camp while starting RB Kenneth Walker III nursed a sore foot, though Walker is now back in action. Should Charbonnet force a timeshare, or even take over the starting job, both he and Walker should produce fruitful weeks regularly. Jaxon Smith-Njigba is in line for a large workload, operating as Seattle’s inside-outside No. 1 wide receiver.</description>

      <title>The Bengals believe Joe Burrow “just enjoyed the best training camp of his career.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f877-de13-afdc-feff40d90000</link>
      <description>Burrow is fully healthy and the Bengals believe “he might have actually improved his accuracy and decision-making” this summer. Though Burrow lacks the rushing upside that the other elite QB1s possess, his exceptional passing talents and top-tier receiving weapons keep him firmly in the top five. The Bengals also reportedly believe Ja’Marr Chase looks “like he could still be ascending after leading the NFL with 127 catches, 1,708 yards and 17 touchdowns.”</description>
