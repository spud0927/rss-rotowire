      <title>A.J. Brown turned his lone target into an eight-yard reception in the Eagles’ Week 1 win over the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1829-dbe3-a9bb-387bd11f0000</link>
      <description>You are not seeing things. Brown went 58 minutes without a target, finally corralling his lone look at the 1:51 mark of the fourth quarter. As was usual last season, Jalen Hurts attempted only 23 passes, but he managed to look No. 3 Jahan Dotson’s way three times. Saquon Barkley also drew five looks. We’re not film watchers, but Brown didn’t seem to be running free. He was either frustrated by sticky coverage or given to decoy usage this evening. It’s an awful way to start the season for fantasy managers, but players like Brown don’t stay down for long. He gets a Week 2 Super Bowl rematch with the Chiefs.</description>

      <title>Saquon Barkley rushed 18 times for 60 yards and a touchdown in the Eagles’ Week 1 win over the Cowboys, adding four receptions for 24 yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-182d-dbe3-a9bb-387f9a650000</link>
      <description>Barkley’s 60 yards rushing would have been the second lowest total of his sensational 2024. He at least compensated with the touchdown, and also made a spectacular one-handed catch. Although he watched Jalen Hurts take touchdowns on the ground, the Eagles attempted only 23 passes. This remains a run-based offense with Barkley at the center. Repeating last year’s towering efficiency and compiling marks probably isn’t in the cards, but Barkley still has as good of a chance as any back to finish as the RB1 overall. A Super Bowl rematch with the Chiefs awaits for Week 2.</description>

      <title>Javonte Williams rushed 15 times for 54 yards and two touchdowns in the Cowboys’ Week 1 loss to the Eagles, adding two receptions for 10 yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1831-dbe3-a9bb-3873a5740000</link>
      <description>Williams capped each of the Cowboys’ first two drives with one-yard scoring plunges. That’s good work if you can get it. If you include passing touchdowns, it was just the third two-score effort of Williams’ checkered career. Williams did not look explosive between the tackles, but he dominated snaps and touches, a trend that will undoubtedly continue for Week 2 after Miles Sanders lost a red zone fumble this evening. That being said, we would expect rookie Jaydon Blue to make his NFL debut against the Giants after he was a “healthy scratch” this evening. Blue missed most of training camp with injury. Despite tonight’s (expected) heavy workload, Williams is still more of a FLEX than RB2 for fantasy purposes.</description>

      <title>George Pickens caught 3-of-4 targets for 30 yards in the Cowboys’ Week 1 loss to the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1835-dbe3-a9bb-3877f16b0000</link>
      <description>It was a typically eventful night for Pickens in his Cowboys debut, as he also committed a personal foul and drew a 34-yard DPI. Never a dull moment. Pickens’ four targets were nine fewer than CeeDee Lamb, but you could see how the interplay between the two wideouts might work. Lamb was soaking up short-to-intermediate looks while Pickens went to work deep. Big gains are undoubtedly coming, especially considering how impressively Dak Prescott was spinning the rock this evening. Pickens will remain a top-30 option for Week 2 against the Giants.</description>

      <title>DeVonta Smith caught 3-of-3 targets for 16 yards in the Eagles’ Week 1 win over the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1839-d332-a1fd-9e3f10b50000</link>
      <description>One of those “targets” was a measly receiver screen. For whatever reason, Jalen Hurts couldn’t get the ball to his wideouts in OC Kevin Patullo’s play-calling debut. If you thought Smith’s night was bad, it blew A.J. Brown’s out of the water, as AJB’s lone look/catch came at the 1:51 mark of the fourth quarter. Not good enough, but Hurts and Patullo now at least have 10 days to go back to the drawing board ahead of a Week 2 Super Bowl rematch with the Chiefs. Smith will find himself in the WR24-30 range for that one.</description>

      <title>Jake Ferguson caught 5-of-6 targets for 23 yards in the Cowboys’ Week 1 loss to the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-183c-db7b-a5dd-b83c9d010000</link>
      <description>Ferguson’s box score doesn’t show his most eventful play of the game, a third quarter end zone hospital ball from Dak Prescott that managed to draw a personal foul on Eagles DB Reed Blankenship. Ferguson is lucky he avoided a concussion. It wasn’t the only time Ferguson was put in harm’s way by Prescott, but it was the most vivid. Despite the horrific yardage total, PPR managers will take the five grabs. That’s a number Ferguson should hit fairly frequently in an offense destined to be pass-heavy. He will be a high-end TE2 for Week 2 against the Giants.</description>

      <title>Dallas Goedert caught 7-of-7 targets for 44 yards in the Eagles’ Week 1 win over the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1840-de13-afdd-5ecbfc5f0000</link>
      <description>Goedert’s seven looks surprisingly led the team on an evening where Jalen Hurts attempted just 23 throws. Seven targets is a number Goedert only reached twice during his abbreviated 2024 regular season. The Eagles are going to do a better job of getting the ball to A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith going forward, but Goedert easily confirmed he remains the team’s No. 3 receiving option. He will be hanging around the TE1/2 borderline for Week 2 against the Chiefs.</description>

      <title>Miles Sanders rushed four times for 53 yards in the Cowboys’ Week 1 loss to the Eagles, also losing a fumble.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1843-de13-afdd-5ecb5f3a0000</link>
      <description>Sanders “added” a -3 yard reception. As usual, Sanders’ good was all too vividly accompanied by the bad. Third quarter patience and explosiveness allowed him to find then hit a huge hole on the perimeter for a 49-yard gain, but he followed it up five plays later with a soft red zone fumble. The game then went into a lightning delay and Sanders wasn’t heard from upon the contest’s resumption. With Jaydon Blue a “healthy scratch” following an injury-marred training camp, Sanders was getting a looksee as the No. 2 back, but he might not get another opportunity in Week 2 against the Giants if Blue is ready to go.</description>

      <title>Jahan Dotson caught 3-of-3 targets for 59 yards in the Eagles’ Week 1 win over the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1848-db7b-a5dd-b84c1f300000</link>
      <description>Confusingly, No. 3 Dotson drew as many looks as DeVonta Smith and two more than A.J. Brown. He led the team in receiving, with his roasting of Kaiir Elam 1-on-1 for a 51-yard gain going down as the game’s longest play. The solid performance confirmed training camp buzz that Dotson was the unquestioned No. 3 wideout, but he’s still going to remain the fourth or fifth option in the passing game more weeks than not. That includes Week 2 against the Chiefs.</description>

      <title>Will Shipley rushed three times for 26 yards in the Eagles’ Week 1 win over the Cowboys before departing with a rib injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-184a-dbe3-a9bb-385bf5e20000</link>
      <description>Mixing in as a change-of-pace back behind Saquon Barkley, Shipley was the only Eagle to notch a 20-yard run before going down. He was announced as “questionable” but never returned following halftime or a lengthy third quarter weather delay. Not great, though he does have 10 days to get healthy for the Eagles’ Week 2 Super Bowl rematch with the Chiefs. Shipley has at least confirmed he’s the unquestioned No. 2 and in line to see a few weekly breather touches when healthy.</description>
