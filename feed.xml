      <title>Jets acquired WR AD Mitchell from the Colts, along with two first-round picks, for CB Sauce Gardner.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5007-d713-ad9e-7c571b720000</link>
      <description>Mitchell was buried on the Colts depth chart after he fumbled a touchdown away before the goalline, costing Indianapolis a win against the Rams. He played only 24 offensive snaps in four games afterwards. This could not be any better of a situation for him to rebound ... except for the fact that the Jets have no real quarterback. Mitchell should quickly become the Jets No. 2 wideout opposite of Garrett Wilson. He’s not worth a huge pre-emptive strike in FAAB or anything given the Jets’ circumstances, but Mitchell does have big time talent and it is exciting to see him in an opportunity where he has a chance to realize it.</description>

      <title>Seahawks acquired WR Rashid Shaheed from the Saints in exchange for fourth and fifth-round picks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5001-d673-a39e-f49197740000</link>
      <description>The trade reunites Shaheed with Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak, who held the same role in New Orleans last year. Shaheed has continued his success as the Saints’ deep ball specialist in 2025, racking up 499 yards and two scores through nine games. A drastic improvement in quarterback play should do wonders for his already strong efficiency, even if there is less volume to go around in Seattle. His presence will likely knock Tory Horton out of the starting rotation once Cooper Kupp is healthy. Horton, who has five receiving scores this year, is only worth holding in deeper fantasy leagues. Shaheed will be an extremely boom/bust WR3 once he gets up to speed in Seattle.</description>

      <title>Bears acquired EDGE Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and a seventh-round pick from the Browns for a sixth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-501a-d713-ad9e-7c5e773b0000</link>
      <description>Tryon-Shoyinka has played just 31 defensive snaps for the Browns this year after being signed as a rotational EDGE player. He’ll try to fill in the hole left by Dayo Odeyingbo’s torn Achilles for the Bears.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) is “dealing with a low-grade high ankle sprain” but has a chance to play this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5025-d45b-affe-55b7e70e0000</link>
      <description>You won’t believe how low this high-ankle sprain is, folks. It’s practically in the ground itself. Any time a high-ankle sprain comes to light we mentally budget for the worst and even if the Jaguars don’t want to admit it, it probably helped drive the acquisition of Jakobi Meyers in the short term. We’ll monitor Thomas’ practice reports this week but it sounds like he’s on the pessimistic side of questionable heading into the week.</description>

      <title>Steelers signed WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5030-d673-a39e-f4b14b950000</link>
      <description>This is team three for MVS this year after spending time in Seattle and San Francisco. He doesn’t appear to be a threat to playing time right away — it is a practice squad contract — but it’s not like the Steelers have much beyond DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin in the receiver room that has proven to be better than MVS. We wouldn’t be surprised if he eventually became a low-volume part of the offense. You don’t need to spend FAAB on him unless you’re in a 20-team league.</description>

      <title>Cowboys acquired DT Quinnen Williams from the Jets for DT Mazi Smith, a 2026 second-round pick and a 2027 first-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5042-d713-ad9e-7c56b5d50000</link>
      <description>Williams is notably not Micah Parsons, but if for some reason you can’t have Parsons, he’s probably on the short list of defensive line stars in the league. He’s a star run defender — something we seem to recall the Cowboys needing — by virtue of splash plays. Williams has only one sack this year, but the Jets have not held many leads and Williams does have 23.5 sacks in his past seasons. The Jets star defender has 1.5 years remaining on a four-year, $96 million extension signed in 2023. So the Cowboys will make sure to have someone with an expiring contract distraction on the roster in 2026, as nature abhors a vacuum. The Jets are now a conceptual football team, the closest thing we’ve seen to one since the Sashi Brown Browns anyway. So from that standpoint, Mazi Smith, a theoretical defensive tackle, is a great addition.</description>

      <title>49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open the 21-day practice window for Brandon Aiyuk (knee/PUP) this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5069-d45b-affe-55ff75180000</link>
      <description>We’re not surprised to see that Shanahan’s Week 10 estimate given in October was too optimistic — the 49ers have been very cavalier about feeding the optimism this year on Aiyuk. Assuming that the 49ers want him to actually have a real runway of practice before he acclimates, it is feeling more and more likely that Aiyuk is only back on the field for the final month or so of the regular season.</description>

      <title>49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said the timeline for Ricky Pearsall (knee) “remains fuzzy.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-506e-d673-a39e-f4ffee6c0000</link>
      <description>Shanahan added that Pearsall will be “evaluated midweek to see whether he can return to practice,” which is a more optimistic point of view. Pearsall-reliant managers have gotten used to this over the last month or so, but it looks like he’s definitely questionable-at-best for a return in Week 10.</description>

      <title>KPRC2’s Aaron Wilson believes the expectation is C.J. Stroud “will not practice Wednesday, or possibly any days this week, and that Davis Mills will start.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5072-d45b-affe-55f6d5210000</link>
      <description>It’s not exactly a surprising revelation to make — if Stroud were going to return, we’d probably only see movement on Thursday or Friday on the practice report — but fantasy managers should set their Week 10 waivers with the expectation that Stroud won’t play against the Jaguars in Week 10. Davis Mills will be a low-end superflex QB2 if and when he is officially named the starter for that game.</description>

      <title>Panthers released QB Hendon Hooker.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5092-d673-a39e-f493cca60000</link>
      <description>Hooker had been on the practice squad since August, but Carolina elected to sign and elevate Mike White over him. It’s possible Hooker thinks he has a better opportunity elsewhere. Even if he does, it’s hard to imagine him finding a path to a starting role at this point.</description>
