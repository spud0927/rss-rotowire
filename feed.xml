      <title>Dolphins general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan said he wants build a team that can win in cold weather.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e0dc-d56e-afff-e6fcafb20000</link>
      <description>Sullivan said the goal in the coming years is to put together a roster of players who can win in Buffalo, New York, and New England in the second half of the season. The Dolphins, practicing and living in Miami, have traditionally been a miserable cold-weather team, leading to a number of late-season collapses going back to the Marino era. Sullivan’s comments echo newly hired head coach Jeff Sullivan, who reportedly wants to ditch the team’s emphasis on speed for size and physicality. “Our division runs through Buffalo and New England and New York, cold-weather places,” Sullivan said. “There’s a saying in our business, fast gets slow but big doesn’t get small. We’re not going to sacrifice speed and explosion and skill for a bunch of big stiff guys, but we’re going to have substance to us at all levels of our team. At corner, at receiver, at running back, and certainly up front. It starts with the quarterback, and then we’ll build this team from the inside out. We’ve got to be dominant on the offensive line, dominant on the defensive line.”</description>

      <title>Bills requested an interview with Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e0e2-dc7a-af9b-efff7a2a0000</link>
      <description>Udinski, 30, is just a few months older than Bills QB Josh Allen and would represent a massive shift for Buffalo after the team fired longtime defense-oriented head coach Sean McDermott, one of the most successful coaches in the NFL over the past decade. Udinski has interviewed for the Browns head coaching job after a 2025 season in which he helped make Jacksonville’s offense one of the most productive in football. Udinski would make for an interesting hire if the Bills are ready to get back to the pass-first approach that made them lethal in 2020 and 2021.</description>

      <title>Bills requested an interview with former Giants head coach Brian Daboll for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e0e8-d35e-a1bf-e5ea8b010000</link>
      <description>Daboll served as Buffalo’s offensive coordinator from 2018 to 2021 before landing the Giants head coaching job. Daboll’s Bills offense was top-five in both yards and points in both 2020 and 2021 as the team shifted to a more pass-first offense with Josh Allen under center. Daboll’s success with Allen could land him the top job in the coming days and weeks as the Bills interview potential replacements for Sean McDermott. That includes 30-year-old Jacksonville OC Grant Udinski and Colts DC Lou Anarumo.</description>

      <title>Bills requested an interview with Dolphins defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e10d-d968-a19b-f9fd976c0000</link>
      <description>Weaver is suddenly a popular name among teams looking to fill head coaching jobs in the coming days and weeks. Weaver, Miami’s defensive coordinator over the past two seasons, has talked to the Ravens and Steelers about their head coaching vacancies and will now enter the fray as Buffalo’s potential top guy after the team fired Sean McDermott. The Bills are also interviewing former Giants head coach Brian Daboll and Jaguars OC Grant Udinsky. Weaver’s Miami defense over the past two seasons has given up the league’s ninth highest EPA per play and seventh highest offensive success rate.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports former Giants head coach Brian Daboll is expected to take the Titans offensive coordinator job if he doesn’t land the Bills head coaching job.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e113-d56e-afff-e7fb23a30000</link>
      <description>Daboll is reportedly prioritizing the Buffalo job after serving as the team’s offensive coordinator from 2018 to 2021. If the Bills pass him over, Russini said Daboll will likely join Robert Saleh as Tennessee’s offensive coordinator. Daboll would be tasked with helping Cam Ward become an NFL-viable starter quarterback after a disastrous rookie season in which he threw 15 touchdowns and seven picks over 17 games. Ward was among the most inaccurate passers in the league.</description>

      <title>Bills owner Terry Pegula said the team’s coaching staff pushed to draft WR Keon Coleman in 2024.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e123-d56e-afff-e7eb090b0000</link>
      <description>Pegula during a press conference Wednesday absolved general manager Brandon Beane of responsibility for the sorry state of the team’s wideout room. Referring to the drafting of Coleman in 2024, Pegula said Beane “has taken, for some reason, heat about it, and I’m here to say a word about it.” Pegula said former head coach Sean McDermott’s wide receivers coaches advocated for taking Coleman, who has been an unmitigated bust over the past two seasons. Pegula added that he fired McDermott — among the league’s most successful coaches over the past decade — based on the Bills’ Divisional Round loss to the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Cardinals will host a second interview with Jaguars defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e15d-dc7a-af9b-efffd7c00000</link>
      <description>Campanile, after coaching one of the league’s best defenses in 2025, seems to be the favorite for the Arizona head coaching job after the team parted ways with Jonathan Gannon. Campanile has interviewed with a numbers of teams, including the Ravens and Dolphins. Jacksonville in 2025 ranked second in takeaways and allowed the NFL’s third lowest rushing success rate and the 11th lowest drop back success rate.</description>

      <title>Bills president of football operations Brandon Beane said Josh Allen could require offseason foot surgery.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e177-d56e-afff-e7ffcf730000</link>
      <description>Though Beane didn’t offer a timeline for when Allen might undergo surgery to repair a foot injury he sustained in Week 16 against the Browns, he was confident would not affect Allen’s availability for organized team activities in the offseason. Allen gutted it out through the foot injury — among others — over the season’s final month, logging 23 rushing attempts over the team’s two postseason games despite the injury. Barring complications, Allen should be ready to go this spring as he prepares for his age-30 season.</description>

      <title>Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said RB Ken Walker is running more decisively.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e194-d968-a19b-f9f504ff0000</link>
      <description>Macdonald praised Walker as the veteran prepares to take over as the Seahawks’ lead back with Zach Charbonnet (ACL) done for the remainder of the season. Walker ran wild against the 49ers in the Divisional Round, totaling 116 yards and three touchdowns on 19 carries. “I think you’re seeing the results in the past X amount of weeks now of ... stacking all those reps,” Macdonald said. “I thought this was the most decisive he’s ran up to this point, and as expected, you just keep getting better and keep finding ways to improve, especially in the run game. He’s done a great job.” Walker has long had issues with looking for the big play and losing yardage instead of taking what the defense gives him. He’ll need to continue being decisive in the NFC title game against a Rams defense allowing the league’s tenth lowest rush EPA since Week 10.</description>

      <title>Seahawks activated RB George Holani (hamstring) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e1b3-d968-a19b-f9f346290000</link>
      <description>Holani has been on IR since he injured his hamstring in Week 12 against the Titans. He could see an uptick in snaps and usage this week against the Rams in the NFC title game with Zach Charbonnet (ACL) done for the season. Holani could rotate with Cam Akers behind lead back Ken Walker, fresh off a three-touchdown outing against the 49ers. A bigger back, Holani could potentially take goal line touches over Walker.</description>
