      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the NFLPA’s publicizing of team report cards was determined by an arbitrator to be in violation of the CBA “and ordered it to stop making public any future report cards.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-57b6-d89c-a1be-ffffd0140000</link>
      <description>It’s a big win for the NFL and its owners, especially those owners who consistently score low on these team report cards — looking at you, Jets. Jets owner Woody Johnson saw his team rank 21st out of 32 teams in the 2024 report card, only for his team to drop to 29th after the 2025 season. Johnson ripped the surveys for being “totally bogus” and played a key role in the attempt to ban them from being published in the future. According to the independent arbitrator, the NFLPA “refused to produce any information or data related to prior years’ surveys” while adding “the Report Cards were designed by the union to advance its interests under the guise of scientific exercise.” Surveys were allowed to continue to be conducted in the coming seasons, but they will remain hidden from the public eye for the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Rams assistant head coach and pass game coordinator Aubrey Pleasant will interview for the Raiders’ defensive-coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-57e5-d355-a5bd-dff515290000</link>
      <description>Pleasant has also interviewed for openings with the Browns and Cardinals, although the Cardinals have already opted to retain last year’s defensive coordinator. Pleasant first joined the Rams in 2023 as their DB coach and passing game coordinator, and has never held a title of defensive coordinator in college or the pros. Pleasant played a key role in helping the Rams’ defense finish in the top-10 in points allowed while also ranking 12th in yards per attempt allowed. He’s drawn enough attention this coaching cycle to suggest that even if he doesn’t land a coordinator role this offseason, one could be in store for him in the very near future.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports the Seahawks will interview Cardinals pass game specialist Connor Senger for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5800-d355-a5bd-df54d1f40000</link>
      <description>Senger has been with the Cardinals since 2022, and recently interviewed for the Bears’ offensive coordinator position. Rapoport reports that the Cardinals hope to retain Senger for the upcoming season, but any chance to make the leap to coordinator would likely spell the end of his time in Arizona.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports a court ruled that discrimination cases filed against the NFL by Brian Flores, Steve Wilks, and Ray Horton “now can proceed in open court.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-582c-d629-a1bc-f83d767c0000</link>
      <description>In the decision, the court writes that “an arbitration forum in which the defendant’s (NFL’s) own chief executive gets to decide the case would strip employees of their rights under the law,” while adding that “it is long overdue for the NFL to recognize this and finally provide a fair, neutral and transparent forum for these issues to be addressed.” Flores first filed a class-action lawsuit against the NFL, the Dolphins, Giants, and Broncos, for conducting “sham” interviews with him in 2022 to satisfy the league’s hiring rules. Wilks and Horton later add their names to the complaint and named the Cardinals and Titans. Should this head to open court, a trial would likely be set to take place where both sides will be heard before a jury ultimately decides if the league discriminated against Flores, Wilks, and Horton during various interview processes.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Seahawks defensive pass game coordinator and DBs coach Karl Scott will remain with the team next season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5850-d629-a1bc-f85d8ce40000</link>
      <description>Scott was under consideration for the Cardinals’ defensive coordinator opening, but the team ultimately decided to stick with Nick Rallis, who joined the team in 2023. Scott has been with the Seahawks since 2022 and helped lead a top defensive unit to a Super Bowl championship this season. He’ll remain with the Seahawks in 2026, but Scott could continue to field calls for coordinator jobs in the future if he continues to coach up elite secondaries like we saw this season.</description>

      <title>Seahawks blocked the Raiders’ request to interview run game specialist and assistant OL coach Justin Outten for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-588d-d629-a1bc-f89dfc7b0000</link>
      <description>Outten is currently a candidate to replace former Seahawks OC and new Raiders head coach Klint Kubiak in Seattle. The Seahawks’ move to block Kubiak’s request to interview Outten for the same gig in Las Vegas seemingly bodes positively for Outten’s odds of getting the Seattle job. ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler broke today’s news, and previously reported that the Seahawks are interviewing four internal candidates for their own offensive coordinator vacancy, including Outten, tight ends coach Mack Brown, pass game coordinator Jake Peetz and quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko.</description>

      <title>Bills hired John Fox as their new senior assistant coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5861-d629-a1bc-f87d40c80000</link>
      <description>Bills TE coach Rob Boras has been promoted, adding run game coordinator to his title. Offensive quality control coach Kyle Shurmur has also been promoted to assistant quarterbacks coach. He held his prior role for three seasons. The Bills also hired former NFL LB Craig Robertson as a defensive quality control coach, Drew Terrell as wide receivers coach and Jeff Rodgers as special teams coordinator.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Brooke Pryor reports that Aaron Rodgers is more likely than not to play for the Steelers in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5894-d89c-a1be-ffdf16000000</link>
      <description>Pryor believes that the Steelers would like to know Rodgers’ intentions “sooner rather than later,” ideally before the NFL Combine for scouting purposes. During new head coach Mike McCarthy’s interview process, McCarthy reportedly laid out a plan to develop 2025 sixth-round pick, QB Will Howard, who missed most of last season due to a “freak” pinky finger injury. McCarthy is a “big fan” of Howard, though one wonders how big a fan he is, given Pryor’s comments about Rodgers’ decision-making timing regarding the NFL Combine.</description>

      <title>Seahawks hired Zach Orr as their new inside linebackers coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-5885-d042-afbc-7dd728440000</link>
      <description>The move reunites Orr with Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald, whom Orr replaced as the Ravens’ defensive coordinator after Macdonald accepted his current role in 2024. Orr reportedly had the same job offer from the Cowboys, but preferred to learn from Macdonald once again.</description>

      <title>Giants hired Addison Lynch as their new defensive backs coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-58f7-d042-afbc-7df74b470000</link>
      <description>National and local beat reporters have been buzzing about Lynch for the last week or so. The Giants made his hiring official today. He spent the 2025 season serving as the Broncos’ cornerbacks coach after spending two seasons as a defensive quality control coach. He held the latter role with the Lions in 2022 and the Chargers from 2018-2019. He also served as an assistant defensive backs coach with the Chargers (2020) and Raiders (2021).</description>
