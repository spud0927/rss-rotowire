      <title>Eagles waived QB Kyle McCord.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e236-de13-afdc-e6ff09b50000</link>
      <description>McCord reportedly had a solid camp but was the odd man out after the team traded for Sam Howell Sunday. Tanner McKee should continue to operate as the team’s top backup to Jalen Hurts, when healthy. McCord will be subject to the waiver process and could find himself scooped up by a team willing to take a more developmental approach with the sixth-round rookie.</description>

      <title>Saints released RB Cam Akers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e22b-db7b-a5dd-e22fbe640000</link>
      <description>Akers and Kendre Miller battled for position this preseason, and Akers ended up being the odd man out. The Saints also waived P James Burnip, WR Roderick Daniels Jr., WR Moochie Dixon, DL Jasheen Davis, DE Jeremiah Martin, DE Omari Thomas, OT Josiah Ezirimand, OT Jonathan Mendoza, TE Seth Green, OG Kyle Hergel and Tyreem Powell, and released TE Michael Jacobson and OL Mike Panasiuk.</description>

      <title>Jaguars released CB De’Antre Prince.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e23a-de13-afdc-e6fb5e2f0000</link>
      <description>The 2024 fifth-rounder was pushed out by an influx of new DBs drafted or acquired by new GM James Gladstone. Prince had a rough showing in the preseason games with a 40.3 PFF coverage grade in 43 coverage snaps. He played 101 defensive snaps with the Jaguars in 2024 and could be a candidate to catch on elsewhere.</description>

      <title>49ers released RB Ke’Shawn Vaughn.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e23d-db7b-a5dd-e23d936f0000</link>
      <description>The veteran back didn’t play in the preseason at all despite the amount of injuries the 49ers running back room dealt with. He’s a likely practice squad candidate after playing with the 49ers last season. The 49ers also waived/injured QB Carter Bradley and QB Tanner Mordecai, while waiving (regular) DL Jaylon Allen and DL Shakel Brown. Finally, they sent OL Isaiah Prince to injured reserve.</description>

      <title>Lamar Jackson (foot) resumed practicing on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e240-de13-afdc-e6cbca1d0000</link>
      <description>Great news. Jackson is practicing as scheduled. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh told reporters on Saturday that Jackson was expected to return today, “unless he doesn’t want to.” Evidently, he wanted to. Fantasy managers can continue drafting Jackson as an overall QB1 candidate.</description>

      <title>Jauan Jennings (calf) missed practice again on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e23e-db7b-a5dd-e23e72e60000</link>
      <description>While there have been reports Jennings could be placed on IR while his contract dispute with the 49ers and calf injury remain, the team made a flurry of roster moves Monday without placing the 28-year-old receiver on injured reserve. Still, Jennings isn’t practicing with less than two weeks before the 49ers’ first game. While it doesn’t have to be dramatic, this saga needs a conclusion sometime soon. Jennings is still in line for a big role in the 49ers’ passing game if he and the 49ers can get on the same page before the season starts.</description>

      <title>Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said, QB Will Howard (hand) will practice in full “soon.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e21c-d332-a1fd-f63e31b80000</link>
      <description>Howard is “moving in the right direction” as he rehabs the broken bone in his throwing hand. He currently sits in the QB3 spot on the Steelers’ unofficial depth chart. Tomlin reportedly “doesn’t know yet” if LB Nick Herbig (hamstring) will be ready for Week 1. ESPN’s Brooke Pryor adds that LB Alex Highsmith (groin) said he is playing Week 1.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports Bengals have restarted negotiations with DE Trey Hendrickson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e240-d332-a1fd-f6767e300000</link>
      <description>Schultz adds that the two sides are exploring “a more unique avenue” and that there is “cautious optimism” the two sides can get a deal done on an extension in short order. This has been one of the more befuddling contract negotiations of the offseason as the two sides have been seemingly far off from any real headway. The Bengals have gone so far as exploring trade options for their All-Pro defensive end, with the Patriots reportedly offering a premium pick for his services. Through it all, Hendrickson remains on the Bengals’ payroll, for the time being, and the two sides have reportedly reignited negotiations with an aim on keeping Hendrickson in Cincinnati this season. Schultz also stated that the Bengals have explored giving Hendrickson more money in 2025 while still allowing his contract to expire after the season. Stay tuned, this one could drag on further.</description>

      <title>Rams HC Sean McVay said OT Alaric Jackson will progress to team drills next week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-e25b-dbe3-a9bb-f25b24020000</link>
      <description>Jackson has been a massive question mark for the Rams this offseason after developing blood clots in June but avoided the PUP and NFI lists last month. The most recent update indicates he could be ready for the start of the regular season, which would be a significant boost to the protection of reeling veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford. Stafford has been dealing with back issues all offseason with the team recently stating the intent is to “keep him upright” in Week 1 against the Texans. Jackson could go a long way in accomplishing that goal. It’ll still be a “wait and see” approach with Jackson but he currently appears to be trending in the right direction.</description>
