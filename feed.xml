      <title>Zay Flowers caught 2-of-7 targets for six yards in the Ravens’ Week 13 loss to the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-c909-d90e-a9da-df0f3d2c0000</link>
      <description>The good news is that Flowers’ seven targets led the team. He logged a 22 percent target share. The bad news? Everything else. The Ravens tried to get Flowers going downfield, but he and Lamar Jackson were seemingly never on the same page. The two-time MVP regularly sailed passes to Flowers and was visibly frustrated with the situation late in the game. To top things off, Flowers coughed up a fumble late in the fourth quarter, putting to rest any hope of a Baltimore comeback. Better days should be ahead for the young wideout, but he was looking like a potential WR1 a month into the season. Now he is fighting for a spot in the WR2 ranks heading into Week 14 versus Pittsburgh.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports Amon-Ra St. Brown is believed to have suffered a low ankle sprain in Week 13’s loss to the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ca9c-db57-afda-debe0b850000</link>
      <description>The team will continue to evaluate ARSB’s injury, but the hope is that St. Brown, who isn’t believed to be a candidate for injured reserve, won’t miss more than 1-2 weeks. The Lions’ schedule is such that they have just one game over the next 16 days, meaning a two-week recovery period could result in just one missed game. It’s far too early to say when we could see him on the field next, but given how the injury looked on the field, it’s safe to say this is pretty good news. We’ll likely get a better sense of where things stand in the coming days.</description>

      <title>Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel said Darren Waller (pectoral) is “in play” to return in Week 13 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb5a-d82c-a79a-fbde69930000</link>
      <description>McDaniel noted that whether Waller returns to face the Saints will depend partly on how Friday’s practice goes. Waller has been listed as limited in both practices to start this week, creating cautious optimism that he could be activated this week. Waller has played in four games this season and scored in three of those games. The veteran tight end would have some high-end TE2 upside if he were to be activate this week. We’ll check back in on his availability when the Dolphins release Friday’s injury report.</description>

      <title>Trey Benson (knee) will not play in Week 13 against the Buccaneers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb60-db57-afda-df7206930000</link>
      <description>Benson was ruled out before the team took the field for Friday’s practice. The second-year back was a limited participant to start the week, but listed as a DNP on Thursday. He appeared to be trending toward a return after being limited in every practice ahead of Week 12’s game, so it’s possible we’re looking at a setback here. This remains a situation to monitor, but for now, we can expect the duo of Bam Knight and Michael Carter to lead the Cards’ backfield against the Buccaneers. In addition to Benson the Cardinals also ruled out OG Will Hernandez (hip/knee) and DT Walter Nolen (knee) for Week 13.</description>

      <title>Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said “Trevon Diggs will be on the field in Detroit in my view.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb63-d6c4-abfb-df63d7930000</link>
      <description>We would like to assume the owner of the Cowboys has a pretty good sense of the health of his players, but we’ll take this with a grain of salt. Diggs was placed on injured reserve after suffering an accident at home late last month and has missed the team’s last six games. The Cowboys have yet to open Diggs’ 21-day return window, which they will need to do if they hope to get him on the practice field this week. With Dallas playing on Thursday in Week 14, the team will need to designate him for a return early in the week.</description>

      <title>Bills LT Dion Dawkins (concussion) will not play in Week 13 against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb6c-d82c-a79a-fbfc5a840000</link>
      <description>Head coach Sean McDermott also ruled out RT Spencer Brown (shoulder), LB Terrel Bernard (elbow), and WR Curtis Samuel (elbow/knee), for Sunday’s contest. With both bookend tackles sidelined, the Bills will likely roll with Ryan Van Demark at left tackle and Chase Lundt at right tackle, which could make life tough for Josh Allen against a defense that has the fourth-highest blitz rate and fifth-highest sack total (34) this season.</description>

      <title>Bills TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) is questionable for Week 13 against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb76-d6c4-abfb-df77bd9a0000</link>
      <description>Kincaid returned to practice on Thursday after being a DNP on Wednesday, and will presumably log another practice on Friday to earn this questionable tag. Fantasy managers banking on his return will want to check the Bills’ inactives 90 minutes before kickoff to ensure Kincaid is active, but he’s clearly nearing a return after missing the last two weeks. Kincaid has yet to top six targets in any game this season, but has two 100-yard performances to his name and has found the end zone in four of his eight games played. If active, he’ll profile as a low-end TE1.</description>

      <title>Devonte Wyatt suffered a fractured ankle in Week 13’s win over the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb7b-d90e-a9da-df7f96260000</link>
      <description>Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said after the game that things “didn’t look good” for Wyatt. Now that the nature of his injury has been revealed, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport notes that Wyatt’s season “is expected to be over.” Wyatt has totaled 27 tackles, four sacks, and six TFLs for the Packers this season, and is among the league’s best interior linemen. His absence will be felt by a defense that ranks fourth in points and yards allowed this season, as rookie sixth-rounder Warren Brinson now appears slated for more work.</description>

      <title>Rams waived K Joshua Karty.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb93-db57-afda-dfb3c7340000</link>
      <description>Harrison Mevis, aka “The Thiccer Kicker,” has won the in-season kicking battle over Karty. Karty has been a healthy scratch by the Rams for three straight weeks after going 10-for-15 on field goal attempts and 23-for-26 on his extra point attempts. In those three games, Mevis has made both of his field goal tries and is a perfect 13-for-13 on PATs. Karty is a sixth-round pick from the 2024 draft class and fared much better in his rookie season, going 29-for-34 on his field goal tries which included six made field goals from 50-plus yards. There are enough kicker-needy teams in the league that suggest Karty should land on a practice squad soon, but his time with the Rams is over.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers HC Todd Bowles said Baker Mayfield (shoulder) is trending toward playing in Week 13 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb98-d90e-a9da-df9f33360000</link>
      <description>Mayfield took the field on back-to-back days to close out the week of practice, and looked good in his final session, per Bowles. The Buccaneers’ signal-caller exited in the first half of last week’s loss to the Rams due to a sprained AC joint, but the fact that the injury is to his non-throwing shoulder was an obvious good sign. We’ll get his Week 13 game status soon, but Mayfield being active would be a good sign for his fantasy managers, and anybody rostering Emeka Egbuka.</description>
