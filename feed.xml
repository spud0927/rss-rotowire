      <title>ESPN’s Jordan Raanan reports the Giants are expected to interview a bevy of candidates for their open head coaching position that includes former coaches Mike McCarthy, Antonio Pierce and others.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7f60-d968-a19b-7ff132b80000</link>
      <description>McCarthy didn’t coach in 2025 after a five-year stint with the Cowboys. He has the most experience of anyone on the Giants’ list, which also includes Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, former Raiders coach and Giants player Antonio Pierce and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula. Raanan passes along that GM Joe Schoen is leading the coaching search and multiple sources believe he’s coming back next year, so the Giants have that going for them after a Schoen oversaw a 6-27 record in the last two years. Norte Dame’s Marcus Freeman removed his name from consideration for the Giants job earlier this week. New York’s coaching search seems to be centered around quantity rather than quality at this point.</description>

      <title>Jets TE Mason Taylor (neck) has been ruled out for Week 18 against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7f69-d56e-afff-ffe99a9e0000</link>
      <description>No surprise here as Taylor hasn’t played since Week 14 due to a neck injury. The 21-year-old tight end finished his rookie season with 44 receptions, 369 yards and a touchdown. With improved health and quarterback play, things should be looking up for Taylor in 2026.</description>

      <title>Bills head coach Sean McDermott told reporters QB Josh Allen (foot) is “good to go” for Week 18’s game against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7f8e-d56e-afff-ffeea5510000</link>
      <description>Allen hasn’t practiced yet this week, but McDermott said he’ll be limited in practice Friday and good to go for the game on Sunday. McDermott said earlier in the week that Allen was trending in the right direction. The Bills are locked into a Wild Card spot, which could make Allen a tricky start in Week 18. McDermott didn’t indicate how much of the game Allen might play as the Bills could turn to Mitchell Trubisky in the second half.</description>

      <title>Dolphins WR Jaylen Waddle (ribs) is questionable for Week 18 against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7f99-dc7a-af9b-ffbf5a7e0000</link>
      <description>Waddle left Week 17’s game against the Buccaneers with a rib injury and didn’t return. The 27-year-old receiver returned to practice Thursday, which is a good sign for his availability despite his questionable designation. Waddle certainly has a chance to play, though with the Dolphins already out of playoff contention, the organization could opt to err on the side of caution.</description>

      <title>Dolphins RB De’Von Achane (shoulder) didn’t practice on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7f9a-d56e-afff-fffaacbd0000</link>
      <description>Achane hasn’t practiced all week. With the Dolphins already eliminated from playoff contention, it seems highly unlikely that the 24-year-old running back will try to tough it out against the Patriots in Week 18. We expect him to be ruled out later today and Jaylen Wright would be the expected starter against New England.</description>

      <title>Dolphins placed TE Darren Waller (groin) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7fa0-d968-a19b-7ff16e650000</link>
      <description>Waller had seen his role in the offense diminish since Quinn Ewers took over as quarterback. The 33-year-old tight end had 66 yards and two touchdowns in his last game with Tua Tagovailoa, but had just 40 yards in a dream matchup against the Bengals in Ewers’ first start. Last week, Greg Dulcich usurped Waller completely. With Waller’s season now over, Dulcich has the role all to himself.</description>

      <title>Bills TE Dalton Kincaid (knee) was limited in practice on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7fa4-d56e-afff-ffec8c840000</link>
      <description>Kincaid missed Week 17’s loss to the Eagles with a knee injury, but the 26-year-old tight end has practiced in a limited fashion all week this week. We expect him to suit up against the Jets in Week 18, though he could see fewer snaps given his condition and the Bills already being locked into a Wild Card spot.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7fa4-d56e-afff-ffec8c840000</guid>

      <title>Commanders ruled out QB Marcus Mariota (hand, quad) for Week 18 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7fbb-d968-a19b-7ffb14400000</link>
      <description>Mariota was deemed doubtful to play by head coach Dan Quinn earlier this week, so his absence isn’t a surprise. Josh Johnson will start for the Commanders as they close out the season against the Tanner McKee-led Eagles. Mariota finishes the year 2-6 as a starter with a 10:7 TD:INT ratio, but ran for 297 yards on 50 attempts and added a touchdown on the ground. He’s a plausible bridge quarterback for someone this offseason. But it’s more likely he’ll return in a backup role.</description>

      <title>Lions head coach Dan Campbell told reporters WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee/ankle) is trending towards playing in Week 18 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7fbd-dc7a-af9b-ffbf5d320000</link>
      <description>St. Brown was limited in Thursday’s practice and figures to be out there on the practice field again Friday given Campbell’s comments. The 26-year-old wide receiver is as tough as they come, which he showed earlier in the season as he played through an ankle sprain against the Cowboys. While the game against the Bears means nothing for the Lions, who’ve already been eliminated from the playoffs, St. Brown is hyper-aware of what his statistics mean in the grand scheme of things. While St. Brown has already secured a Pro Bowl nod this year, surely he wants to have a big game in hopes of making the All-Pro team as well. While it’s possible the Lions shut him down in the second half, expect St. Brown to be involved heavily early in this one.</description>

      <title>Bengals RB Chase Brown (illness) will play in Week 18 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7fc5-dc7a-af9b-ffff65610000</link>
      <description>Brown is back at practice Friday after missing time earlier in the week with an illness. The 25-year-old running back is good to go for the matchup in Week 18 against the Browns. He needs just 53 yards rushing to have his first 1,000-yard rushing season of his career. Brown is an RB1 for managers playing their fantasy championship in Week 18.</description>
