      <title>Jets coach Aaron Glenn said Allen Lazard (shoulder) will “miss a couple of weeks.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f3f-d05a-adda-bfbf79790000</link>
      <description>Lazard was spotted in a sling after the Jets’ first preseason game and has, by most accounts, been lapped by Josh Reynolds in the Jets WR2 competition. This puts his Week 1 availability into question and an IR or PUP stint is probably not out of the question as well. Lazard does not need to be held unless you’re in a wildly deep league.</description>

      <title>Romeo Doubs (back) left Tuesday’s practice with trainers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f45-df63-a199-df6fc6110000</link>
      <description>He got medical attention after coming up with a deep ball, was crouched over for a few minutes, then walked off “holding” his lower back. It’s hard to speculate on what kind of injury may have happened here based on this information, but the Packers can ill-afford to lose Doubs as they’ve already been practicing without Dontayvion Wicks and Jayden Reed. It’s all coming up Matthew Golden right now for fantasy purposes. Doubs told reporters after practice that he was okay, but we wouldn’t be surprised if he was handled gently over the next few days.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Kevin Fishbain believes that Caleb Williams “hasn’t been consistent enough” in training camp and that his accuracy “hasn’t been there like it was last summer.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f55-df63-a199-df7f8cfb0000</link>
      <description>We didn’t get to see Williams work with the 1s in Sunday’s preseason tune-up against the Dolphins, but it’s not exactly a glowing endorsement from Fishbain on the behind-the-scenes work. Fishbain also gave a “stock down” update to the entire Bears passing game, saying it “hasn’t been a smooth camp” for them. This doesn’t necessarily mean a whole lot — it’s just practice — but we’d love to be reading more positive updates on Williams and the Bears right now as we search for breakout quarterbacks at lower ADPs.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zac Jackson believes that Shedeur Sanders has “generally outplayed [Dillon] Gabriel throughout camp.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f86-d90d-a5bd-bfdfc5300000</link>
      <description>Despite this, he thinks the Browns may let Dillon Gabriel start Cleveland’s second preseason game on Saturday against the Eagles. Gabriel missed the first preseason game with a hamstring injury, but returned to 11-on-11s today. Meanwhile, Sanders is “the only one of the primary four yet to take any snaps with the No. 1 offense.” The priors have guided Cleveland so far and Gabriel remains above Sanders on the depth chart — but this looks to be a big week for Gabriel, who will have to assert himself as deserving of the No. 3 job.</description>

      <title>Mason Taylor (ankle) returned to Jets practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9fae-d05a-adda-bfae27400000</link>
      <description>Said to have been dealing with a high-ankle sprain, Taylor missed a grand total of six days of practice. Not bad. Assuming Taylor is fully healthy for the season-opener, he’ll slide in as the Jets No. 1 tight end and be a fantasy TE2 on what looks like a dire receiver depth chart outside of Garrett Wilson.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Alec Lewis believes the Vikings could keep QB Max Brosmer on their initial 53-man roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9fb0-df63-a199-dfbba2290000</link>
      <description>“Brosmer sees the field, processing the defensive picture in a way you cannot teach. Coaches have raved about his smarts behind the scenes, too. If the Vikings don’t add him to the 53-man, they’d risk losing a reliable player at the game’s most critical position,” Lewis writes. Brosmer completed 5-of-8 passes for 47 yards and a touchdown in Minnesota’s preseason opener against the Texans. This is probably just training camp hype, but Brosmer played well enough that we should at least take it somewhat seriously — and anyone who quarterbacks Minnesota’s offense as things stand currently could have fantasy value.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Daniel Popper reports Najee Harris (eye) is “doing some jogging” on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9fb4-df63-a199-dfbf2c850000</link>
      <description>Things have progressed at a glacial enough pace for Harris that this qualifies as an optimistic update. Until we hear anything about him doing football activities, we’d continue to assume he doesn’t stand much of a chance of getting off the PUP list before the regular season starts.</description>

      <title>Rhamondre Stevenson (undisclosed) did not practice on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9fe7-d05a-adda-bfe7f5370000</link>
      <description>The team signed UDFA RB Shane Watts on Tuesday. Perhaps it’s nothing, but with Stevenson not practicing since his 7/36 game in the preseason opener, this is a situation worth keeping an eye on. TreVeyon Henderson would undoubtedly be the lead back for New England if Stevenson was sidelined for any reason.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Kevin Seifert reports the Vikings confirmed Rondale Moore (knee) will be placed on injured reserve and miss the 2025 season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9ff2-d05a-adda-bff21e690000</link>
      <description>Moore will miss a second consecutive season due to preseason injury, which opens up the bottom of the Vikings wideout depth chart. The Vikings haven’t seem overly impressed with rookie Tai Felton on offense, which means they may need to go out and get a stopgap receiver during Jordan Addison’s early-season suspension. Moore will turn 26 next June, so his career is far from over unless he wants it to be, but he’ll likely be seeking another prove-it contract in 2026.</description>

      <title>Kenneth Walker (undisclosed) is back at practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9ffe-d45c-a7fc-9ffe249f0000</link>
      <description>It seems like if Walker’s foot (what he missed time with earlier in camp) is an issue, it’s one that will be long-term managed by the Seahawks. It’s probably not worth making a big deal out of at this point. Seahawks HC Mike Macdonald said “We have a plan for Ken, and we’re sticking to the plan,” when asked about Walker yesterday.</description>
