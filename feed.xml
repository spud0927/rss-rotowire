      <title>Buccaneers signed RT Luke Goedeke to a four-year, $90 million contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0c86-dbe3-a9bb-3cd7ed000000</link>
      <description>Goedeke was selected in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Bucs, becoming a key part of the offensive line. He started all 30 games that he played over the last two seasons and finished 2024 with a 76.4 PFF run-blocking grade, No. 18 amongst offensive tackles. Entering the final year of his rookie deal, Goedeke now gets an extension done and the Bucs get to keep a key piece of the offensive line for the foreseeable future.ESPN’s Jeremy Fowlerreports the deal is worth $90 million over four years, with $50 million guaranteed.</description>

      <title>Broncos RB J.K. Dobbins is listed as the starter on Denver’s unofficial Week 1 depth chart.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0c9a-dbe3-a9bb-3cdbb4e20000</link>
      <description>Dobbins is notably ahead of rookie R.J. Harvey as the starter. This is just an unofficial depth chart that ultimately does not mean much when games start, but signifies that Dobbins is at least a significant part of the Broncos’ plans this season. Harvey should also split snaps out of the backfield and his fantasy outlook for this season should not change. Tyler Badie is listed as RB3, while Jaleel McLaughlin is RB4, indicating Sean Payton would like to utilize Badie in passing-down situations more often.</description>

      <title>Panthers WR Hunter Renfrow is listed as a starting wide receiver on the team’s unofficial Week 1 depth chart.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0ca1-dbe3-a9bb-3cf390c80000</link>
      <description>Renfrow was cut and re-signed to the Panthers’ active roster after Jalen Coker was placed on injured reserve. The 29-year-old is the only player listed in a slot wide receiver role on the team’s depth chart. Coker was expected to play the slot frequently this season, but now that he is sidelined, Renfrow will be in the slot role. He will still trail Tetairoa McMillan and Xavier Legette in the pecking order but could earn his way to fantasy viability early on in the season.</description>

      <title>Jaguars listed Travis Hunter as a starting wide receiver and backup cornerback on their Week 1 depth chart.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0d66-dbe3-a9bb-3d77d89e0000</link>
      <description>The Jaguars had initially listed Hunter as a starting wide receiver and backup cornerback at the beginning of preseason and continue to do so ahead of Week 1. Though not much stock should go into these early depth charts, camp usage indicates Hunter will be primarily an offensive player, with secondary usage on defense. Head coach Liam Coen said the Jaguars are evaluating Hunter’s Week 1 usage due to missed time for an upper body injury. The rookie No. 2 overall pick is still slated for versatility, but fantasy managers can expect to get his offensive production at the WR3 level to start with.</description>

      <title>Cowboys signed FB Hunter Luepke to a two-year extension worth up to $7.5 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0f6b-d332-a1fd-9f7f39870000</link>
      <description>Luepke’s new deal includes $5 million guaranteed. He had been set to make $1 million in 2025. Pro Football Focus graded Luepka as last year’s eighth best pass-protecting back. He was graded 32nd out of 36 qualifying backs in run blocking grade. Last season he had 38 yards on 12 rushing attempts. He’ll be on the field often this season blocking for Javonte Williams and the rest of the Dallas running backs.</description>

      <title>Chiefs WR Jalen Royals (knee) did not travel with the team to Brazil.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0faa-d332-a1fd-9fbe22870000</link>
      <description>Royals will miss at least the first game of the season as he works through knee tendinitis that flared up in late August. The rookie was expected to be a rotational wideout and a special teams player to start the season. With Royals sidelined, look for JuJu Smith-Schuster and Hollywood Brown to see significant snaps in Week 1 against the Chargers. Both receivers will be borderline options in deeper fantasy formats.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports Jets LG Alijah Vera-Tucker “suffered a potentially serious [arm] injury and could miss significant time.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-0fd0-d332-a1fd-9ff6b2f80000</link>
      <description>Vera-Tucker’s 2025 season could be over before it begins after sustaining an arm injury days before the Jets’ Week 1 opener against the Steelers. Vera-Tucker missed the entire 2022 and 2023 seasons due to injury before returning and playing 15 games for the Jets in 2024. The Athletic’s Zack Rosenblatt said Vera-Tucker “was a standout in camp, dominant in the run game and appeared to be finally fully healthy” headed into the regular season. His injury is a massive blow to the Jets offense, expected to be predicated on the run. Pro Football Focus graded Vera-Tucker as the 33rd best run blocking offensive lineman in the NFL last season out of 148 qualifying players. This news is certainly a blow to Breece Hall and Braelon Allen, and perhaps the whole New York offense.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Vic Tarfur suggested the “hype” surrounding WR Ricky Pearsall this offseason was “premature.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1001-d332-a1fd-9637b0d60000</link>
      <description>This comes as unpleasant news to the Pearsall truthers who months ago crowned the second-year wideout as the Niners’ unquestioned No. 1 receiver. Jauan Jennings’ return to action, 49ers beat writers have said, should take the shine off Pearsall. “He was out there at practice every day and did look good, but — sorry, fantasy football people — it sure seemed like the hype and jump to No. 1 receiver status was premature,” Tarfur said. “Pearsall is very quick and will still catch a fair number of passes, but physical corners will have some success against him, and Jennings’ return allows the 49ers to not put too much on Pearsall’s plate after all.” Pearsall should still see a good number of looks in Week 1 against the Seahawks, and certainly has top-30 in his range of fantasy outcomes.</description>

      <title>Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said Jaylen Warren will be the team’s “featured runner” to start the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1012-de13-afdd-56db07ab0000</link>
      <description>Tomlin’s comments come after Warren on Tuesday signed a two-year contract extension with the Steelers. “His progress has been very evident and he’s to be congratulated,” Tomlin said of Warren, who in 2024 had 821 total yards and one touchdown, sharing the backfield with Najee Harris. “Certainly he’ll be our featured runner. Certainly you’ll see [Kaleb Johnson/Kenneth Gainwell], but at what time and at what degree [will depend week-to-week].” Warren is listed as the team’s RB1 on their Week 1 depth chart. Gainwell is listed as RB2, and Johnson as RB3. Warren could see a solid workload both as a rusher and a pass catcher in Week 1 against the Jets. He’s flex worthy in all fantasy formats.</description>

      <title>Browns RB Jerome Ford is listed as the starter on the team’s Week 1 depth chart.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1028-dbe3-a9bb-307b81400000</link>
      <description>The veteran will get the nod as the top back on the Cleveland depth chart for Week 1 against the Bengals. That might mean Ford will simply play the team’s first offensive drive, or it could mean he’ll operate as a workhorse over rookie RB Dylan Sampson. Ford over the past two seasons has 81 catchers for 544 yards and could suffice as a PPR flex option with check-down artist Joe Flacco under center for the Browns. The team’s backfield will be throwing into further chaos if Quinshon Judkins signs with the team in the coming days or weeks.</description>
