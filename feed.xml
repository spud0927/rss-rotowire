      <title>Saints signed RB Audric Estime to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-08c7-d651-a9df-69d726190000</link>
      <description>With Kendre Miller down for the year with a torn ACL, Estime looks like the replacement back between the tackles. Devin Neal is set up to have the first run behind Alvin Kamara, but it’s possible that Taysom Hill gets so many of the carries and gadget plays that Neal has no real ceiling. No need to rush out and claim Estime, but if he impresses the Saints in their building, perhaps he’ll get a shot later in the season. New Orleans re-signed Velus Jones to their 53-man roster as a direct replacement for Miller, but Jones is just a kick returner at this point.</description>

      <title>Chargers RB Hassan Haskins (hamstring) is “doubtful” for Week 8, according to head coach Jim Harbaugh.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-08cc-da18-a39a-dadfe2190000</link>
      <description>Haskins was an estimated DNP in Monday’s practice and now Jim Harbaugh is calling the 25-year-old doubtful for the Chargers’ Week 8 game against the Vikings. He likely suffered the strain on Sunday and without practicing the first two days of a short week, Haskins is unlikely to go on Thursday night. Nyheim Hines looks to be Kimani Vidal’s backup, though Vidal is the only fantasy-relevant player in the Los Angeles backfield.</description>

      <title>Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said, “we’re pressing forward with everybody that we have” when discussing the team’s offensive struggles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-08fe-d651-a9df-69ff4c050000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s DJ Bien-Aime reports Ryans has no plans to move off of offensive coordinator Nick Caley, despite the team’s offensive struggles. The Texans are coming off a 27-19 Monday night loss to the Seahawks and have crossed 20 points only in games against the weak Titans and Ravens defenses. C.J. Stroud and company have not found the same success as his 2023 rookie season and despite the issues, Ryans is not making changes yet. He said, “It all starts with me...We got to play better. We got to execute better on game day.” The Texans head into a Week 8 matchup against a 49ers defense that ranks No. 7 in scoring and may be missing WR Nico Collins (concussion) for the game.</description>

      <title>Chargers LT Joe Alt (ankle) was a limited participant in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-090a-d99b-a1df-3b0e617f0000</link>
      <description>Both Alt (ankle) and Pipkins (knee) were practicing in a limited capacity on Tuesday after being listed as limited for Monday’s practice session. Alt has been out since injuring his ankle in Week 4 and was able to get in a pair of limited practice sessions last week; his ankle was heavily taped in Tuesday’s practice while Pipkins wore a brace on his knee. Head coach Jim Harbaugh said Alt is “doing anything and everything he can” to play Thursday against the Vikings. He added that Alt and Pipkins are both “game-time decisions, day-of-game decisions” for Week 8. Getting both tackles back would be a big boost to Justin Herbert’s protection moving forward.</description>

      <title>Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy (ankle) was limited in Tuesday’s walk-thru practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0930-df81-ab9b-7ff76cb90000</link>
      <description>McCarthy was limited in another practice at the beginning of Week 8 while Carson Wentz (shoulder) was a full participant. Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell confirmed Wentz will be starting on Thursday against the Chargers as McCarthy continues to ramp up from the ankle injury he suffered over five weeks ago. Max Brosmer will be the backup for now with McCarthy seemingly working to 100-percent health before starting again.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports the Raiders have told EDGE Maxx Crosby “they aren’t shopping him and won’t trade him.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0955-d651-a9df-6955acb80000</link>
      <description>Crosby has been on the perennial trade block with the Raiders’ struggles to become a competitive team. Las Vegas sits at 2-5 in a difficult AFC West division, leading to further speculation about a Crosby trade and reports the Cowboys inquired about the 28-year-old. However, Pelissero reports the Raiders told Crosby he isn’t being shopped despite interest and that Crosby would like to stay with the Raiders. The four-time Pro-Bowler has 63.5 sacks in 102 career games thus far and looks to be staying in Vegas for now.</description>

      <title>Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell said J.J. McCarthy (ankle) doesn’t need to be “130 percent” to see game action.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0c2d-df81-ab9b-7eefd58a0000</link>
      <description>A month and a half after McCarthy injured his ankle and a month after he shed his walking boot, O’Connell is still speaking indirectly about how McCarthy might get back on the field in 2025. He said Tuesday that the QB has to be able to “do his job for 60 minutes without having any setbacks” before he’s under center again. When that might be is anyone’s guess as the Vikings play rhetorical games with McCarthy’s status after his abysmal start to the season. Carson Wentz (shoulder) is expected to start the team’s Week 8 game against the Chargers, and Max Brosmer is expected to serve as the backup.</description>

      <title>Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski said he’s hopeful David Njoku (knee) will be available for Week 8.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0c72-d651-a9df-6d77a24e0000</link>
      <description>Njoku, who did not play in Week 7, remains day to day with his knee injury, per Stefanski. Harold Fannin caught four of his five targets for 36 yards in a run-heavy attack in Week 7 against Miami with Njoku sidelined. His fantasy prospects would take something of a hit if Njoku returned this week against the Patriots. Both players would be usable in 12-team formats however.</description>

      <title>Browns OT Jack Conklin cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0c78-d99b-a1df-3e7cf19b0000</link>
      <description>Head coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed as much during his Wednesday press conference. Conklin was sidelined last week against the Dolphins after suffering the head injury in Week 6 against the Steelers. He should be available in Week 8 against the Patriots. Cleveland needs all the offensive line help it can get: Pro Football Focus grades the Browns line as the league’s worst pass-blocking unit and the tenth worst run-blocking unit.</description>

      <title>Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel said a backfield split would be an ideal approach to the team’s running game.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0c96-df81-ab9b-7ed7af400000</link>
      <description>When asked about De’Vone Achane’s massive workload — Achane has 212 touches through seven games — McDaniel said he would like to see Ollie Gordon more involved in the rushing attack. Game script for the lowly Dolphins often doesn’t allow such a distribution, however, as Achane remains the team’s primary pass-catching option. McDaniel mentioned the Dolphins’ Week 3 game against Buffalo as an ideal backfield distribution, with Achane seeing 12 carries to nine for Gordon. Achane had seven catches in that game, and remains one of the most reliable running backs in fantasy. Gordon should be stashed on benches for now in case Achane misses time.</description>
