      <title>Jets owner Woody Johnson said the Jets offense “would look good” if “we can just complete a pass.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07d3-da18-a39a-dfd3973e0000</link>
      <description>Welp. That’ll be one for the career obituary on Justin Fields. It seems clear that the Jets owner has not soured on Aaron Glenn and instead believes that the Fields play was simply a mistake. The Jets have not announced anything about who their quarterback will be this week, but ownership doesn’t usually just say something like this about a pass offense with a quarterback they intend to keep starting.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Rich Cimini reports the Jets are “moving toward” naming Tyrod Taylor the starter.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07d9-da18-a39a-dfdbaf3d0000</link>
      <description>Well, yeah. Consider this a companion blurb to what we just posted about Justin Fields. We sincerely doubt that Taylor is going to stay healthy for longer than a month at 36 years old, but he can competently shepherd the passing offense in a way that Fields simply hasn’t. Add up a game against the Bengals defense to the ledger and suddenly Taylor is squarely on the QB2 superflex line in a week with six teams on bye.</description>

      <title>Eagles signed EDGE Brandon Graham.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07fa-d651-a9df-6fff6c520000</link>
      <description>Terms weren’t disclosed, but we would be floored if this wasn’t a one-year contract. Graham will replace ZaDarius Smith (retired) at EDGE. The Eagles are lacking production at the position in the absence of Nolan Smith and actually used first-round pick Jihaad Campbell there at times against the Vikings in Week 7. Graham will give them a higher floor even if he’s not 2015 Brandon Graham anymore.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles said Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) and Chris Godwin (fibula) are “getting better” but “didn’t know whether either are in play to return to practice this week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-07fe-da18-a39a-dfff17280000</link>
      <description>It’s only an initial lean after a Monday night game, but we’d be surprised to see Irving or Godwin suit up on a short week. It’s not quite the auto rule-out that we saw last Monday night for Irving, so that’s a small trend in a positive direction. Irving has not played since Week 4.</description>

      <title>Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell announced Carson Wentz (shoulder) will start Minnesota’s Week 8 game against the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0811-d99b-a1df-3a1d04d70000</link>
      <description>O’Connell did say that J.J. McCarthy (ankle) might have had a chance to go if this was a Sunday game, making him a possible option for Week 9. Given how slow the Vikings have been with McCarthy, we’ll believe it when we see it. Wentz will make a fine superflex QB2 against the Chargers given how poor their defense has played of late. Max Brosmer will be Minnesota’s backup in Week 8.</description>

      <title>Vikings designated RB Aaron Jones (hamstring) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-080f-d99b-a1df-3a0fc6360000</link>
      <description>His 21-day window is now open, meaning he can be inactive for only three more games before returning to the roster or being ruled out for the season. Per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Jones could “potentially” return for Week 8’s game against the Chargers on Thursday night. Jones doesn’t necessarily need practice reps to play, but we’re still curious about the practice report listings for him today and tomorrow. If Jones does return, he’ll cut Jordan Mason down to a FLEX play and perhaps be a usable-but-risky FLEX play himself against a weak Chargers run defense.</description>

      <title>Chargers signed RB Trayveon Williams to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-081d-da18-a39a-da1f9c0e0000</link>
      <description>It sounds like a hedge against Hassan Haskins missing Week 8. Nyheim Hines is the on-roster backup to Kimani Vidal, though Hines is more of a pass-catching back. It’s possible Williams is active against the Vikings, though we couldn’t confidently predict a real role for him at this point.</description>

      <title>Falcons released WR Ray-Ray McCloud.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-085d-d651-a9df-695d97390000</link>
      <description>McCloud was sent home by the Falcons last week over “a private matter,” and it seems like the distance did not make whatever the team and McCloud don’t see eye-to-eye about any better. The 29-year-old wideout is talented enough to catch on in another receiver room if the issue isn’t a big deal to other teams.</description>

      <title>Chargers placed DL Otito Ogbonnia (elbow) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0860-d99b-a1df-3a6c89170000</link>
      <description>He’ll miss at least the next four weeks with an injury suffered against the Colts in Week 4. The 2022 fifth-rounder has largely been a below-average run defender per PFF, and had played just 66 snaps this year.</description>

      <title>Raiders WR Jakobi Meyers said he “for sure” still desires to be traded.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0873-d99b-a1df-3a7ff5b00000</link>
      <description>Asked about the trade deadline, Meyers said “I got no control over that. If I’m here, I’m here.” He also noted that he is open to an extension with the Raiders, but that “that window kind of just closed with the offseason ... If it gets done, I don’t care for real. I really just want to be in a good spot for me [and] my family.” It certainly makes plenty of sense for the Raiders to move on from Meyers given how far away they look right now, and it could enable them to give a longer trial to second-rounder Jack Bech inside. But it sounds like Meyers just wants an extension either way, perhaps limiting his market.</description>
