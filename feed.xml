      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (ankle/shoulder) is questionable to play in Week 4 against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-875c-d95b-addb-ef5ec8f80000</link>
      <description>Jennings was sidelined through the week’s first two practices before logging a limited session on Friday. He registered the same participation levels back in Week 2. He was active on game day and caught 5-of-9 targets for 89 yards and one touchdown. He was only dealing with the shoulder injury at that point but Jennings tends to play through ailments whenever possible. He is a WR3/FLEX if active.</description>

      <title>49ers QB Mac Jones (knee) is questionable for Week 4 against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-87e9-deb6-a7fd-d7fff4f80000</link>
      <description>49ers starting QB Brock Purdy (toe/left shoulder) has been cleared to play, so Jones has been put back into the No. 2 spot. He played admirably in his two starts, completing 53-of-80 passes for 563 yards, four touchdowns and one interception and rushing seven times for five yards despite aggravating a summer PCL sprain in Week 3. For fantasy managers in two-quarterback leagues with no one better to stash, he can be left on the bench this week to see how Purdy’s health holds up. For everyone else, he can be dropped. The 49ers also ruled out WR Jordan Watkins (calf) and DT CJ West (thumb). FB Kyle Juszczyk passed the NFL’s concussion protocol and will be active for Week 4 against the Jaguars.</description>

      <title>Jaguars RB Bhayshul Tuten (shoulder) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 4 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-87f2-dca3-a9fb-bffb85a00000</link>
      <description>Tuten was seen sporting a red non-contact jersey in practice again this week, but the Jaguars are just being smart with their spry rookie running back. The team continues to employ a three-player rotation in the backfield, hampering Tuten’s upside. In the two games since Jacksonville traded away Tank Bigsby, Tuten is averaging seven carries and 1.5 targets per game, which is enough to keep him in the FLEX spot.</description>

      <title>Jaguars WR Dyami Brown (shoulder) is questionable for Week 4 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-87fc-deb6-a7fd-d7ff9eed0000</link>
      <description>Brown was sidelined on Wednesday, but returned for limited practice sessions on Thursday and Friday. The 25-year-old seemingly has decent odds of suiting up, but he could be frequently subbed out for backup WR Parker Washington, who led the team with 11 targets last week. Brown is just a boom-bust FLEX option.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Chris Godwin (ankle, questionable) is expected to make his 2025 debut against the Eagles on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8b73-deb6-a7fd-dbffa0e30000</link>
      <description>Things had been trending this way with Godwin’s full practices, but we never take that for granted when a player is returning from long-term injured reserve. It’s just in the nick of time for the Bucs, who are coming out of a rugged 3-0 start to the season without Mike Evans (hamstring). The question since April has been how Godwin and Emeka Egbuka’s somewhat duplicative skill-sets will feature alongside each other. Although Godwin has been a PPR machine basically any time he has been out there during his career, Egbuka gets a fairly significant rankings advantage as we wait to see what kind of form Godwin is in after his serious injury and long layoff.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Baker Mayfield (biceps, questionable) is good to go against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8b78-d95b-addb-eb7e67e00000</link>
      <description>It’s frankly a bit surprising the Bucs are going through the motions of pretending Mayfield is “questionable,” but Schefter confirms the obvious that he will be out there for a potential early-season playoff preview. Mayfield will be suiting up as both Chris Godwin and LT Tristan Wirfs return. Of course, Mike Evans (hamstring) will be on the shelf. That, coupled with a tough Eagles matchup has Mayfield on the QB1 borderline despite his solid start.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter confirms Bucs LT Tristan Wirfs (knee, questionable) is expected to make his 2025 debut against the Eagles on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8b7a-d95b-addb-eb7ef75c0000</link>
      <description>The Bucs have seemed to have this date circled for some time, amd Wirfs has thankfully hit the bullseye. His return comes as Baker Mayfield is banged up with a biceps issue and Mike Evans is sidelined with a hamstring ailment. Although Chris Godwin (ankle) is also returning, Wirfs’ presence could potentially lead to an increased focus on the Bucs’ struggling running game as the passing game nurses its ill health.</description>

      <title>Justin Fields (concussion) has been cleared to start Week 4 against the Dolphins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8bd3-d6e9-af9d-8bd37ebe0000</link>
      <description>Things had been trending this way after Fields practice in full on both Thursday and Friday. Sidelined for Week 3, Fields had an extra day to get ready for Week 4 with the game part of a Monday night double-header. Excellent in Week 1 and awful in Week 2, Fields is returning to an A+ matchup in the ‘Fins. The only problem is the same is true for Miami’s beleaguered defense. Although Fields’ dual-threat means he always has a high-end QB1 ceiling, his floor is low enough to treat him as more of a high-end QB2.</description>

      <title>Darren Waller (hip) will make his Dolphins debut Monday evening against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8bd8-d6e9-af9d-8bd874610000</link>
      <description>Coach Mike McDaniel said Waller appeared “firmly ready to contribute” while still acknowledging he would be on a snap count. Always injured before his brief one-year retirement last season, Waller missed most of training camp before being sidelined Weeks 1-3. Even at age 33, he likely still has big-play upside, it’s just so hard to see him getting there often enough to provide true 12-team league value. He is nevertheless a name worth putting on watch lists with bye weeks beginning in Week 5.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Jaylen Warren (knee, questionable) will be active for Sunday’s Ireland game against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-8bdb-d6e9-af9d-8bdb2c6c0000</link>
      <description>Warren popped up with the “knee” designation on Friday, but it seems it was purely precautionary. The Steelers have promoted veteran RB Trey Sermon from the practice squad, but that appears to have more to do with rookie Kaleb Johnson’s special teams woes. Handling basically all the work that matters in Pittsburgh’s backfield, Warren is a high-end FLEX, if one with a little more injury risk than usual this week.</description>
