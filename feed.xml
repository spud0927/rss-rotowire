      <description>Sutton’s early-game successes allowed the Broncos to cruise to an easy victory in the second half. The Broncos’ No. 1 wide receiver caught 5-of-5 targets for 81 yards and a touchdown in the first half. He bullied Bengals’ would-be tacklers from the jump, looking fluid and assertive with the ball in his hands. His 8.8 yards after the catch average is a season-high. On his 20-yard score, he got open on a post route in the Bengals’ red zone, leaping to catch the pass from the four-yard line and coming down in the end zone. Sutton is a WR2 against the Eagles in Week 5.</description>

      <title>Marvin Mims caught 6-of-6 targets for 69 yards in the Broncos’ Week 4 win over the Bengals, adding one rush for 16 yards and one touchdown.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98ba-dca3-a9fb-bdbb92250000</link>
      <description>Mims racked up explosive gains, both through the air and on the ground, against the Bengals. He delivered a critical reception on the Broncos’ final drive before halftime by beating his cornerback one-on-one and securing the target for a 28-yard gain before the safety could get to him. Mims found the end zone earlier, on the Broncos’ third drive, via a 16-yard end-around thanks to a big block by WR Pat Bryant. Mims was later seemingly saved from an embarrassing fumble on a punt return when the referees called the recovering defender for a fair catch interference penalty after snatching the ball from Mims’ juggling hands when he bobbled it. Mims remains a volatile FLEX against the Eagles in Week 5.</description>

      <title>Troy Franklin caught 4-of-8 targets for 55 yards in the Broncos’ Week 4 win over the Bengals.</title>

      <description>Franklin’s box score would look a lot different had he not dropped a pass on a post route that hit his hands as he was streaking 40 yards downfield. To his credit, he looked good on his four catches, with his longest of the day occurring on the Broncos’ fourth drive. Head coach Sean Payton sent him in motion out to the left. He shot upfield, before breaking inward on a dig and hauled in the 23-yarder. He caught a six-yard pass two plays later. Franklin’s volatile target-earning keeps him in upside-FLEX territory for the Broncos’ Week 5 game against the Eagles.</description>

      <title>Evan Engram caught 4-of-7 targets for 29 yards in the Broncos’ Week 4 win over the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98d0-deb6-a7fd-dbdf9e320000</link>
      <description>Engram still looks more agile than many veteran tight ends and Bo Nix looked his way when pressured a couple of times, but Engram has lost a step. He had a tough drop on the Broncos’ final drive in the first half, prompting the broadcast to display a graphic noting he entered the game with 36 career drops. On the plus side, Engram’s seven targets were the second-most among Broncos pass catchers. For those who wish to keep him rostered, the usage is enough to justify it for now. He is a TE2 against the Eagles next week.</description>

      <title>J.K. Dobbins rushed 16 times for 101 yards in the Broncos’ Week 4 win over the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98d3-d6e9-af9d-9ad3121c0000</link>
      <description>Head coach Sean Payton is 38 games into his Broncos tenure and, unbelievably, this is the first time a player has run for more than 100 yards in a game for Payton during that span. Dobbins had made it known that he hoped to be the first player to do so when he faced his former Los Angeles Chargers team last week. He would have accomplished his goal a few plays earlier if the 17-yard gain he picked up on the Broncos’ fourth drive had not been called back due to a penalty. The veteran back looked great this evening, churning through contact on runs up the middle, operating as the Broncos’ lead running back. He also added one reception for four yards. Dobbins remains an RB2 next week against the Eagles.</description>

      <title>RJ Harvey rushed 14 times for 58 yards in the Broncos’ Week 4 win over the Bengals, adding four receptions for 40 yards and one touchdown.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98c1-d6e9-af9d-9ad1482b0000</link>
      <description>Harvey was heavily involved from start to finish, though he undeniably benefited from J.K. Dobbins taking a breather after clearing 100 yards rushing late in the game. To Harvey’s credit, though, he was on the field for multiple red zone plays, one of which was a direct snap to him from the Bengals’ three-yard line. The play was defeated and he ultimately lost a foot race to the sideline. Early on, he dropped a pass roughly 15 yards downfield at the Bengals’ 30-yard line that likely could have resulted in a touchdown, but head coach Sean Payton promisingly called a run for him on the next play, assuring the rookie rusher that he had not been doghoused. Payton subbed Harvey in after Dobbins became the Broncos’ first 100-yard rusher in Payton’s tenure, allowing Harvey to be on the field for a red zone sequence that resulted in a 12-yard receiving score for the young running back. Harvey is an RB3/FLEX with upside against the Eagles in Week 5.</description>

      <title>Jake Browning completed 14-of-25 passes for 125 yards in the Bengals’ 28-3, Week 4 loss to the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98de-d95b-addb-f8ded9ca0000</link>
      <description>Browning and the Bengals actually scored first in this one, effectively matriculating the ball downfield on the opening drive before coming away with three points. Once the scripted plays were gone, things fell apart. That was their only drive totaling more than six plays. They went three-and-out four times. To Browning’s credit, he was willing to target Ja’Marr Chase in tight coverage early, but the two simply failed to connect on Browning’s deep passes. Browning also rushed three times for four yards. He is a low-end QB2 against the Lions in Week 5.</description>

      <title>Ja’Marr Chase caught 5-of-8 targets for 23 yards in the Bengals’ Week 4 loss to the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98f2-d95b-addb-f8f649110000</link>
      <description>This was tough to watch. The Bengals’ fill-in starter, QB Jake Browning, was willingly targeting Chase in tight coverage early on. On the ninth play from scrimmage, Browning unbelievably failed to notice Chase streaking downfield on a post route with no safety in sight, instead choosing to throw short to WR Mitchell Tinsley. Later in the game, Chase could be seen exasperatedly pleading his case to head coach Zac Taylor, who evidently had no answers. Chase is a borderline WR1/2 against the Lions next week.</description>

      <title>Tee Higgins caught 3-of-6 targets for 32 yards in the Bengals’ Week 4 loss to the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98e5-deb6-a7fd-dbffdac70000</link>
      <description>Higgins had a ceiling game when these teams faced off in Week 17 last year. The Bengals’ No. 2 wide receiver was seemingly headed toward a useful stat line this time, catching 2-of-3 targets for 25 yards on the first drive. The first of which was an acrobatic, contested back-shoulder reception. He then proceeded to catch just one pass for the rest of the night. Head coach Zac Taylor was unable to call an effective game once the opening script was used up. Higgins is just a WR3/FLEX with upside against the Lions next week.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98e5-deb6-a7fd-dbffdac70000</guid>

      <title>Chase Brown rushed 10 times for 40 yards in the Bengals’ Week 4 loss to the Broncos, adding 3 receptions for 31 yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-98f7-d95b-addb-f8f792710000</link>
      <description>Brown arguably functioned as the Bengals’ offensive focal point early on. He totaled seven combined carries and targets on his team’s first 16 plays. He was the only Bengals running back to log more than one carry all evening, and his 31 yards receiving were the second-most among Bengals pass catchers. The offense petered out after the opening script, however, and he was unable to deliver a usable stat line. Brown is a borderline RB2/3 against the Lions in Week 5.</description>
