      <title>Chargers WR Ladd McConkey (ankle) was a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7a8b-d1e7-a1fa-7aeb19820000</link>
      <description>McConkey had dealt with a calf issue last month, but now pops up with an ankle issue to open the week. It is still early, so a limited practice participation indicates McConkey is on track to play in Week 11 against the Jaguars. If he does miss time, Keenan Allen should see a boost in targets. Stay tuned to McConkey’s practice participation the rest of the week, but expect him to be in the fantasy WR2 range this week.</description>

      <title>Jaguars WR Parker Washington (hamstring) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7a8e-d713-ad9e-7ede81680000</link>
      <description>Washington made an impact with a punt return touchdown and a receiving touchdown in the Jaguars’ Week 10 loss to the Texans. With Travis Hunter confirmed to be out for the season, Washington is in line to be the Jags’ slot receiver and a fantasy WR3/4 the rest of the way. However, a hamstring injury kept the 23-year-old out of practice to start the week. It is still early, so fantasy managers should stay tuned to practice reports later in the week for Washington’s Week 11 status. Should Washington miss time, the newly acquired Jakobi Meyers is next man up while Brian Thomas Jr. should return to WR1 status in the Jags offense if he returns from his ankle injury this week.</description>

      <title>Jaguars WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7a92-d45b-affe-7f96ad9a0000</link>
      <description>Thomas starts out this week limited after not participating the first two practices of last week. His participation indicates Thomas is trending to return to the field Week 11 against the Chargers. Fantasy managers should stay posted for his practice status the rest of the week as a full practice gives us more confidence that Thomas will play. If he does suit up, Thomas is a fantasy WR2 with Travis Hunter out for the season and Parker Washington now dealing with a hamstring injury.</description>

      <title>Seahawks WR Tory Horton (groin/shin) was a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7aa3-d1e7-a1fa-7aeb83bf0000</link>
      <description>Horton was dealing with a groin injury last week before also injuring his shin in practice. He missed Week 10, but is on track to return with a limited practice participation to start the week. The addition of Rashid Shaheed nullifies some of Horton’s deep ball fantasy value, but the rookie is still a boom-or-bust play in deep leagues.</description>

      <title>Browns WR Isaiah Bond (foot) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7aa8-d713-ad9e-7efc2e3b0000</link>
      <description>Bond missed Week 10 with a foot injury but returns in a limited fashion to open Week 11. A full practice later in the week boosts Bonds’s chances of playing against the Ravens, but he does not have much fantasy relevance in the Dillon Gabriel offense. Cedric Tillman (glute) was also limited a week after coming off injured reserve. Tillman is ahead of Bond is the pass-catching order.</description>

      <title>Jaguars TE Brenton Strange (hip) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7a98-d713-ad9e-7edc45dc0000</link>
      <description>Strange had his 21-day practice window opened this week and was a limited participant in his first practice back. With Travis Hunter out for the season, Parker Washington dealing with a new hamstring injury, and Brian Thomas working back from an ankle injury, Strange may be in line for major usage upon his return. He tallied 23 targets from Weeks 1-4 and should be in the low-end TE1 range upon his return, whether that is Week 11 against the Chargers or Week 12 against the Cardinals.</description>

      <title>Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon said RB Trey Benson (knee) is “taking it day by day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7abb-d45b-affe-7fbfef920000</link>
      <description>At this point, Benson has been out four games and is slated to miss his fifth this week. There is still no confirmation on severity of his injury or a timetable other than Gannon vaguely saying he is “doing better” last week and he is “taking it day by day” this week. It sounds like Benson’s practice window won’t be opened until next week at the earliest, so fantasy managers can expect him back on the field Week 12 at best, but more likely Week 13 against the Buccaneers, barring setbacks.</description>

      <title>Broncos coach Sean Payton said RB RJ Harvey will “have more opportunities” when talking about the potential absence of J.K. Dobbins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7d8f-d45b-affe-7d9f034e0000</link>
      <description>Dobbins is dealing with a foot injury and is reportedly a candidate to be placed on injured reserve. That means he can safely be ruled out for Week 11, making Harvey the next man up. Payton noted Harvey’s size when talking about his ability to take on more work, saying, “He’s built to last, and that’s important.” Harvey has eight pounds on Tyler Badie and 18 pounds on Jaleel McLaughlin. It seems like a given that Harvey would see more work with Dobbins out, but it’s nice to hear it from Payton himself, given how fickle the head coach can be with his backfield touches.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports, “There certainly is a possibility that Garrett Wilson (knee) gets put on injured reserve.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7d5e-d1e7-a1fa-7ffed5b80000</link>
      <description>Rapoport might just be reading the tea leaves here, but it’s a reasonable assessment of the situation. Wilson re-aggravated his lingering knee injury on Sunday and is now expected to miss 3-4 weeks. The Jets are midway through another lost year and Wilson is under contract through the 2023 season. Neither party stands to gain much from rushing him back. Wilson has already been ruled out for Week 11. Putting him on injured reserve later today would force him to miss at least three more games.</description>

      <title>49ers GM John Lynch said “the intention” is to get Brandon Aiyuk back on the field this year.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7e03-d1e7-a1fa-7eebfc4a0000</link>
      <description>The 49ers keep pushing back Aiyuk’s return date and now Lynch isn’t even putting a timeline on it. The team hasn’t designated him to return from the PUP list yet, meaning he might not even be that close to taking the field. Aiyuk is recovering from the multi-ligament knee injury he suffered in the middle of the 2024 season. The injury was more complicated than a standard ACL tear and it’s unclear when he will be ready to suit up. The question Lynch was answering was whether this could be a redshirt year for Aiyuk. He rebuffed the idea, but then ominously ended his statement with, “But we’ll see, no absolutes there.” It sounds like the 49ers have at least considered the possibility that Aiyuk doesn’t play this year. Needless to say, it doesn’t sound like Aiyuk will be returning anytime soon.</description>
