      <title>Xavier Worthy (ankle) is active for Week 12 against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b181-db57-afda-f7b3c90c0000</link>
      <description>Left guard Kingsley Suamataia is also active. He was listed as questionable because of a concussion. Worthy was always expected to suit up this week after getting in a full practice on Friday. He will be a fantasy WR4 in a must-win matchup for Kansas City. Inactive for the Chiefs are CB Josh Williams, RB Isiah Pacheco, WR Jalen Royals, TE Jared Wiley, RB Elijah Mitchell, and OL Wanya Morris.</description>

      <title>Lions CB D.J. Reed (hamstring) is active for Week 12 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b192-d90e-a9da-bf9ff2b50000</link>
      <description>Reed, a critical part of the Detroit secondary, will suit up for the first time since sustaining a serious hamstring injury in early October and landing on injured reserve. It’s not the best development for Jameis Winston and the Giants pass catchers. The Giants were massively run heavy in Week 11 against the Packers. Lions declared CB Terrion Arnold, RB Craig Reynolds, CB Nick Whiteside, DL Quinton Jefferson, and DL Mekhi Wingo inactive against New York.</description>

      <title>Steelers declared QB Aaron Rodgers, LB Alex Highsmith, OG Andrus Peat, DT Brodric Martin-Rhodes and DL Logan Lee inactive for Week 12 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b18f-d413-ad9f-b5dfa8f10000</link>
      <description>As usual, Rodgers made his status some big drama when it turns out there really wasn’t any. It seemed all along that Mason Rudolph would play. We suppose Rodgers supposedly taking things down to the wire bodes well for his odds of missing only one game and returning in Week 13. It goes without saying we will be forced to let you know all about it this upcoming week.</description>

      <title>Bengals declared QB Sean Clifford, RB Samaje Perine, WR Jermaine Burton, TE Cam Grandy, DE Trey Hendrickson, and DE Cam Sample inactive for Week 12 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b192-d90e-a9da-bf9f29a70000</link>
      <description>Perine was listed as doubtful with an ankle injury, so this doesn’t come as a huge surprise, but it is now official. Without him in the lineup, Chase Brown should see the vast majority of the carries and also get an uptick in receiving work. He’s locked in as a top 10 option this week, even if the Bengals trail the Patriots for much of the game.</description>

      <title>Packers WR Matthew Golden (shoulder/wrist) is inactive for Green Bay’s Week 12 game against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b193-d413-ad9f-b5df4ae50000</link>
      <description>The rookie season continues to go south for Golden, who has not cleared 40 receiving yards in a game since Week 6. He’s droppable in re-draft leagues at this point. Active off the questionable line for the Packers are Dontayvion Wicks (calf), Savion Williams (foot), and Lukas Van Ness (foot) — Van Ness is making his first appearance since Week 6. Also inactive for Green Bay are: RB Josh Jacobs (knee), LB Quay Walker (neck), CB Nate Hobbs (knee), K Lucas Havrisik, LB Jamon Johnson and OL Donovan Jennings.</description>

      <title>Ravens declared WR Rashod Bateman, RB Rasheen Ali, CB Kenyon Martin, OG Ben Cleveland, OT Carson Vinson, DT Aeneas Peebles, and QB Cooper Rush inactive for Week 12 against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b193-d90e-a9da-bf9fccd70000</link>
      <description>There are no players of note inactive for the Ravens, with all due respect to Bateman, who was ruled out before the weekend. The Ravens will be operating at full strength against a Jets team that will start Tyrod Taylor for the first time this season. DeAndre Hopkins, who ran the second-most routes of any Ravens receiver in Week 11, will take over in Bateman’s absence.</description>

      <title>Patriots declared WR/KR Efton Chism III, TE C.J. Dippre, DT Joshua Farmer, G Caedan Wallace, QB Tommy DeVito, and LB Jahlani Tavai inactive for Week 12 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b195-d90e-a9da-bf9fa6330000</link>
      <description>No huge surprises here; however, with Chism out for the game, the Patriots may turn to TreVeyon Henderson or Terrell Jennings to return kicks</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b195-d90e-a9da-bf9fa6330000</guid>

      <title>Bears declared LB T.J. Edwards, LB Noah Sewell, LT Theo Benedet, RB Travis Homer, DT Jonathan Ford, QB Case Keenum, WR Jahdae Walker for Chicago’s Week 12 game against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b199-d413-ad9f-b5dd1ee20000</link>
      <description>Benedet was questionable with a quad injury that he picked up in practice on Thursday. It may be wise to downgrade Chicago’s rushing attack slightly given how effective it became when Benedet took over at left tackle. Ozzy Trapilo is set to start in his stead. Edwards, Sewell and Homer were declared out on Friday from their various injuries. The other three are healthy scratches, with Keenum serving as the third quarterback.</description>

      <title>Rhamondre Stevenson is officially active for week 12 against the Bengals</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b1a1-db57-afda-f7b370370000</link>
      <description>It was trending this way for much of the week, but Stevenson will officially return to the field on Sunday. Rookie TreVeyon Henderson has played well in Stevenson’s absence, but we should expect some form of a committee here. With the Patriots heavy favorites against a banged up Bengals team, it’s possible that they can ease Stevenson back in durinf his first game back.</description>
