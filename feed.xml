      <title>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer reports Texans secondary coach Dino Vasso is a “name of interest” for the Cardinals defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-24d4-d629-a1bc-b4dd2a8a0000</link>
      <description>Vasso also interviewed for the Titans DC job before it went to Gus Bradley. Breer adds Rams assistant head coach Aubrey Pleasant is a possibility for the job. As one of the last teams to fill their head coaching vacancy, the Cardinals are going to be left trying to find up-and-comers for their coordinator positions.</description>

      <title>Bills GM Brandon Beane said CB Dorian Strong (neck) is “going to have a procedure that will determine whether he can play.”</title>

      <description>The 2025 fifth-round pick played in four games for the Bills before suffering the injury, and he’d played 39 percent of the snaps to that point so he was trending towards being a real contributor. His future in the league is in doubt.</description>

      <title>Bills GM Brandon Beane said K Tyler Bass (hip/groin) is expected to be Buffalo’s kicker in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2503-d042-afbc-7dd3980a0000</link>
      <description>Beane noted there was an outside chance that Bass could have kicked in the Super Bowl had the Bills made it, leaving us to believe that there’s little doubt he’ll be available at the start of next season. Bass missed the entire 2025 regular season with the injury.</description>

      <title>Cardinals head coach Mike LaFleur said he will call plays for the Cardinals in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2507-d629-a1bc-b51f584a0000</link>
      <description>LaFleur said he “missed it” during his three years as Sean McVay’s offensive coordinator and noted that “the worst playcall is a late playcall.” Stapled to an ineffective Zach Wilson early in his career, it’s hard to fully understand LaFleur’s upside as a playcaller at this point. It’s certainly possible he does better in Arizona than he did in New York.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapaport believes Michigan DC Wink Martindale is a “name to watch” for the Cardinals defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2533-d042-afbc-7df3268e0000</link>
      <description>Martindale appeared to be heading towards getting the Jets defensive coordinator job earlier this offseason, but after Aaron Glenn decided he wanted to call plays the two sides went separate directions. Presumably Martindale would have play-calling authority in Arizona if he were the choice, as Mike LaFleur has zero defensive coaching experience.</description>

      <title>Bills hired former Titans quarterbacks coach Bo Hardegree as their quarterbacks coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2563-d355-a5bd-af7794600000</link>
      <description>Hardegree was asked to call plays for the Titans for most of last season, first to supplement Brian Callahan, then to replace him after he was fired. That made it two straight seasons where Hardegree took over as a playcaller midseason, since he was on Josh McDaniels’ doomed 2024 Raiders staff. Joe Brady is hoping to not make it three times in a row.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers hired Indiana co-offensive coordinator Chandler Whitmer as their quarterbacks coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-25cb-d355-a5bd-afdf8e8e0000</link>
      <description>Whitmer was co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the National Champion Indiana Hoosiers, helping shape an offense with prospective first-round pick Fernando Mendoza. The Bucs are adding to the offensive staff under new offensive coordinator Zac Robinson after Josh Grizzard was let go. Whitmer will be the quarterbacks coach for Robinson, working with Baker Mayfield as he tries to recover from a shaky second half of the 2025 season.</description>

      <title>Jets announced they completed an in-person interview with former Panthers head coach Frank Reich for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2609-d355-a5bd-af5d5a370000</link>
      <description>The Jets completed an in-person interview with Reich, indicating he is a finalist for the team’s offensive coordinator role. A former head coach of the Panthers and Colts, Reich was Stanford’s interim head coach briefly in 2025. should he join Aaron Glenn’s staff, Reich would be the offensive play-caller and a senior leader of the coaching staff. Rumors have had Reich attached to the job and a hire could be completed soon, pending other interviews.</description>

      <title>CBS Sports’ Matt Zenitz reports Dolphins quarterbacks coach Nathaniel Hackett is viewed “among the early possibilities” for the Cardinals’ offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-268e-d355-a5bd-afdef9bc0000</link>
      <description>Hackett only just accepted the Dolphins’ quarterbacks coach job in January, making this report an interesting one. The Cardinals just hired head coach Mike LaFleur, who is calling plays on offense. LaFleur is now gathering offensive coordinator candidates to interview, with Hackett in mix. The 46-year-old succeeded LaFleur as Jets offensive coordinator a few years ago and worked with Mike’s brother, Matt, in Green Bay. Hackett’s tenure as Dolphins quarterbacks coach may be over after mere days if LaFleur decides he is indeed the candidate for the job.</description>

      <title>Steelers beat writer Mark Kaboly reports the Steelers are “close to” hiring Vikings tight ends coach Brian Angelichio as offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2698-d629-a1bc-b69d4b5a0000</link>
      <description>Angelichio was also the Vikings’ passing game coordinator. It was not the most successful season for the Vikings’ passing game, but Angelichio had been in that role since 2022 with previous success from Sam Darnold’s and Kirk Cousins’ offenses. He worked under Mike McCarthy in Green Bay and McCarthy is going back to familiarity with the long-time NFL tight ends coach. According to Kaboly, Angelichio’s deal could be official as soon as Wednesday; he would become the Steelers’ offensive coordinator with McCarthy calling plays.</description>
