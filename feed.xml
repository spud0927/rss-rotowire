      <title>George Kittle was not targeted in the 49ers’ preseason Week 2 game against the Raiders.</title>

      <description>Kittle started and played with Purdy through the end of the first possession but was not targeted. Purdy connected with second-year wide receiver Ricky Pearsall on his first three pass attempts while both Christian McCaffrey and Jauan Jennings were held out. The fantasy upside for all primary contributors on this offense is considerate as the 49ers look to return to the top five in scoring in 2025 after ranking 14th a season ago.</description>

      <title>Browns HC Kevin Stefanski said he hopes to have all four QBs for the team’s preseason finale against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b498-d05a-adda-be9aa20f0000</link>
      <description>Both Shedeur Sanders (oblique) and Kenny Pickett (hamstring) missed Saturday’s preseason game against the Eagles, but Stefanski is already on record saying he is “cautiously optimistic” that Sanders will be back next week. The Browns still have a lot to figure out at quarterback with just 11 days to go until roster cutdown day. It’s not often we see teams roster four quarterbacks, but with so much uncertainty behind Joe Flacco, the Raiders may benefit from rostering a handful of signal-callers.</description>

      <title>Patrick Taylor (shoulder) is questionable to return to the 49ers’ preseason Week 2 game against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b49b-df63-a199-fdbb92cf0000</link>
      <description>Taylor drew the start in the backfield in the absence of Christian McCaffrey, Isaac Guerendo, and Jordan James, losing six yards on four carries prior to departing with a shoulder injury. While listed questionable to return, it would stand to reason that his day is done. Corey Kiner was the next back up Saturday.</description>

      <title>49ers OL Dominick Puni (knee) was ruled out for preseason Week 2 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b49f-df63-a199-fdbfefaa0000</link>
      <description>Puni is in line to start at right guard for a team looking to return to the top five in scoring after a down 2024 regular season. He was immediately ruled out for the remainder of the contest, making his situation worth monitoring during the coming weeks.</description>

      <title>49ers RB Corey Kiner was carted from the field in Saturday’s preseason game due to an ankle injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b49f-d45c-a7fc-b69fa3090000</link>
      <description>Kiner is a UDFA from Cincinnati who has been impressing in Niners camp. The rookie broke off a 19-yard run in the second quarter and remained down after the play, only to later be carted from the field. While he’d typically be considered a long shot to make the roster, Kiner may have had an opening given the current state of the 49ers’ backfield. We’ll hopefully know more on his injury soon.</description>

      <title>Ashton Jeanty rushed seven times for 33 yards and a touchdown in the Raiders’ preseason Week 2 game against the 49ers, adding two yards on his lone reception.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b4a2-d45c-a7fc-b6bad0340000</link>
      <description>Jeanty briefly left the contest in the first quarter with what was described as a shoulder injury before returning to the field and running over a San Francisco defender on a 13-yard carry, his longest of the game. He would later display his raw power again while pushed into the end zone while remaining upright from the one. The swift overreaction to his mundane preseason debut a week ago seems silly in retrospect, with his performance today reinforcing his status as a top tier selection in the early rounds of fantasy drafts this season.</description>

      <title>Brock Bowers caught his only target for 28 yards in the Raiders’ preseason Week 2 game against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b4af-d45c-a7fc-b6bffae10000</link>
      <description>Bowers displayed his elite athleticism while hauling in a 28-yard bomb down the right sideline over a defender in tight coverage against the 49ers Saturday, reinforcing his status as fantasy’s top tight end off the board for the 2025 season. He played on two drives with the starters, the second of which ended in an Ashton Jeanty touchdown plunge from one yard out. The Raiders offense looked much better than it did a week ago, calming some of the offseason nerves for fantasy managers in the process.</description>

      <title>Geno Smith completed 6-of-8 passes for 55 yards in the Raiders’ preseason game against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b4ae-d90d-a5bd-b6ff410f0000</link>
      <description>Smith started things off with a deep throw to the outside to Brock Bowers, who “mossed” his defender in single coverage to haul in a 28-yard reception. Smith has now completed 7-of-11 preseason passes for 70 scoreless yards and has looked in command of the offense in limited action. He’ll profile as a QB2 for most weeks for fantasy, but could have some upside as a matchup-based streamer in the right situation.</description>

      <title>Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel said he’s not concerned about De’Von Achane’s (soft tissue lower-body injury) Week 1 availability against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b4b8-d05a-adda-beba0ca10000</link>
      <description>It’s a nondescript soft tissue lower-body injury for the Dolphins’ RB1. McDaniel said Achane could be out between “days and weeks,” to further add to the mystery, making his status one to watch until he officially returns to action. Second-year back Jaylen Wright would be the immediate favorite to replace Achane on most downs, but rookie sixth-rounder Ollie Gordon could also see some work in short-yardage and goal-line situations. The Dolphins kick off the 2025 season in 22 days, which will hopefully prove to be enough time for Achane to get right.</description>

      <title>Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel said ZDT Zach Sieler (unspecified) will be out “between days and weeks.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b4d0-d90d-a5bd-b6dbabf90000</link>
      <description>McDaniel said that Sieler likely would have suited up for Saturday’s preseason game against the Lions if it were a regular season game. The veteran lineman who signed a three-year extension this offseason now has 22 days to get right before the Dolphins visit the Colts in Week 1. While the timeline for Sieler’s return is murky, McDaniel said he is not concerned about his Week 1 availability.</description>
