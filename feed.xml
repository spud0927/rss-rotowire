      <title>Falcons EDGE Leonard Floyd (hamstring) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b0c-d673-a39e-ff9d7a060000</link>
      <description>Floyd ties for a team-high 19 quarterback pressures, with two sacks to boot. He also has just two tackles, but remains an impactful pass rusher nonetheless. The Falcons were also without LG Matthew Bergeron (ankle) on Thursday. They play the Colts overseas in Week 10.</description>

      <title>Texans EDGE Will Anderson (quad) was limited in Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b12-d713-ad9e-7f5689580000</link>
      <description>It’s an upgrade for Anderson after Wednesday’s DNP, it seems like there’s a real chance he’ll be one of the few Texans on the injury report to actually play in this week’s game against Jacksonville. Jalen Pitre (concussion) DNPed for a second day in a row, while Denico Autry (knee) also upgraded to limited.</description>

      <title>Saints RB Alvin Kamara (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b05-d673-a39e-ff959eaa0000</link>
      <description>The Saints continue to limit Kamara in practice, though the limited reps seem to have little impact on his in-game performance. The 30-year-old running back faces the Panthers this weekend, whose star DE Derrick Brown (elbow) notably appeared on the injury report today. Were Brown to miss the game, Kamara could have an easier time running up the middle, though he would remain an RB3 in the ranks.</description>

      <title>Texans RB Nick Chubb (foot) was limited in Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b14-d1e7-a1fa-5bfe7c5b0000</link>
      <description>Chubb is probably in line to remain the starter over Woody Marks for Houston’s do-nothing run attack in Week 10. Dameon Pierce (personal) was also limited today, and should that linger on it would likely force the Texans to get deeper into their bench if Chubb can’t go on Sunday.</description>

      <title>Texans TE Dalton Schultz (knee/shoulder) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b16-d1e7-a1fa-5bfe00420000</link>
      <description>He’ll be one of many secondary targets for the Texans on Sunday as Davis Mills makes his first start of the season and tries to keep the wheels from completely careening off into the ditch. No pressure, Davis. We wouldn’t excitedly start any non-Nico Collins Texans receivers in fantasy this week, though Schultz has a TE2 case.</description>

      <title>Jaguars WR Dyami Brown (concussion) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b20-d713-ad9e-7f74a86e0000</link>
      <description>Barring a setback, Brown should be available for the Jaguars’ Week 10 game against the Texans. Brown and recent acquisition, WR Jakobi Meyers, will man the perimeter while WR Parker Washington lines up in the slot. The latter player is seemingly the best bet to lead the team in targets, while WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) is expectedly stuck on the sideline after failing to practice on Wednesday and Thursday.</description>

      <title>Browns QB Shedeur Sanders (back) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b27-d1e7-a1fa-5bef51070000</link>
      <description>Sanders’ improvement puts him on track to be active for No. 2 quarterback duties on game day. Current starting QB Dillon Gabriel is completing just 59.9 percent of passes while averaging 4.9 yards per pass attempt. The Jets traded away their best defensive players earlier this week, but Gabriel will likely be without TE Harold Fannin Jr., who appeared on Thursday’s injury report with a hamstring injury. Sanders can be rostered by those who desperately need a speculative QB2 stash.</description>

      <title>Dolphins RB Ollie Gordon (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b24-d1e7-a1fa-5beedb190000</link>
      <description>Gordon injured his ankle in Week 9, after logging a career-high 10 carries in Week 8. He earned at least one target per game in four straight games. The injury is an unfortunate development for a player who was beginning to develop a floor. If active, RB4-worthy garbage-time usage could be in the cards for the rookie running back.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b24-d1e7-a1fa-5beedb190000</guid>

      <title>Steelers EDGE Alex Highsmith (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b5d-d713-ad9e-7f5d95600000</link>
      <description>Highsmith is now on track to play in Week 10 against the Chargers. The veteran pass rusher accounts for 15 quarterback pressures, four sacks and 16 tackles this season. The Steelers field a generally fantasy-friendly defense, though having Highsmith active is obviously a plus. His Friday participation level should clarify things.</description>

      <title>Chargers RG Mekhi Becton (knee) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5b62-d1e7-a1fa-5bea55ce0000</link>
      <description>Becton’s continued participation is a positive, but it would be great to see him upgrade to full participation on Friday. Chargers backup OT Bobby Hart (knee/ankle) remains sidelined, unfortunately. That Chargers’ offensive line is in rough shape, though the team has effectively navigated offensive tackle issues in the past. Stay tuned.</description>
