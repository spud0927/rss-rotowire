      <title>Jets interviewed Michigan DC Wink Martindale for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c8af-dc7a-af9b-cfbf868e0000</link>
      <description>It was part of an announcement of eight names that the Jets had preliminary interviews with, those other names are: Browns safeties coach Ephraim Banda, Packers defensive run game coordinator DeMarcus Covington, Vikings defensive passing game coordinator and cornerbacks coach Daronte Jones, Broncos assistant head coach and defensive passing game coordinator Jim Leonhard, internal Jets DB coach and defensive pass game coordinator Chris Harris, and Lions safeties coach Jim O’Neil. (Mathieu Araujo, the Dolphins cornerbacks coach, was also revealed earlier today.) Martindale hasn’t had any outside interest since last offseason, when he interviewed for the Falcons and Colts defensive coordinator roles.</description>

      <title>Dolphins completed an interview with Jaguars DC Anthony Campanile for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c8b6-d56e-afff-eefe124e0000</link>
      <description>Surprisingly the Dolphins are the only team so far to interview or request an interview with the Jaguars defensive coordinator who oversaw a breakout season where the Jags finished sixth in defensive DVOA. Campanile might be a name to file away for next year, much like Jesse Minter was in 2025 after his initial breakout success as Chargers defensive coordinator.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports the Cowboys “plan to bring in” Eagles defensive passing game coordinator and DBs coach Christian Parker for an in-person interview.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c8b9-d35e-a1bf-cdfb0e5d0000</link>
      <description>It looks like the Cowboys are gearing up for the second phase of their defensive coordinator interviews, this time in-person. They requested Parker a few days ago initially. Parker with join Jonathan Gannon and Daronte Jones as in-person interviews with the Cowboys.</description>

      <title>Rams TE Terrance Ferguson (hamstring) is not on Los Angeles’ final Divisional Round injury report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c8c3-d35e-a1bf-cdc3d5c80000</link>
      <description>Ferguson practiced in full all three days this week and will return to the Rams’ 13-personnel sets after being inactive against the Panthers. His role was growing towards the end of the season, but with all of Davis Allen, Colby Parkinson, and Tyler Higbee also active, Ferguson will just be a DFS punt dart throw on this slate.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Mike Silver reports that the Eagles “might draft a quarterback this spring.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c84b-dc7a-af9b-cfffa81b0000</link>
      <description>Silver adds that Eagles backup QB Tanner McKee “is also highly regarded within the building.” Hurts reportedly “fashions himself” as the NFL’s Michael Jordan, chasing excellence with a “hyper-focus that can come off as aloofness.” He has reportedly “been the source of much internal frustration, including from teammates other than” WR A.J. Brown. That said, Hurts “likely isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.” There is “a sense inside the locker room” that head coach Nick Sirianni, general manager Howie Roseman and owner Jeffrey Lurie “are reluctant to criticize Hurts,” and Lurie “remains confident that an offseason reset can thrust Philly back into Super Bowl contention.” Hurts, 27, did not have a good year, but he led the team to a Super Bowl victory one year ago and has three years left on the five-year, $255 million extension.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers completed an interview with former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c8ea-dc7a-af9b-cfffd3950000</link>
      <description>Yesterday, ESPN’s Jeff Darlington reported that the Buccaneers’ offensive coordinator could appeal to McDaniel because it gives him “full autonomy of the offense,” with head coach Todd Bowles focused on the defensive side of the football. The Eagles, Lions and Chargers are also reportedly interested in hiring McDaniel as their next offensive coordinator, though all three teams possess offensive-minded head coaches.</description>

      <title>Raiders will interview Bills OC Joe Brady for their head-coaching vacancy on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c8f6-dc7a-af9b-cfff0d5e0000</link>
      <description>This is Brady’s first reported connection to the Raiders. He and the Bills notably take on the Broncos on Saturday. If things go well, he will have yet another positive mark on his resume as he heads into the interview. His offense is averaging 5.9 yards per play, ranking fourth among Divisional Round competitors.</description>

      <title>Raiders will interview with 49ers OC Klay Kubiak for their head-coaching vacancy on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c8fa-d56e-afff-eefa0c200000</link>
      <description>Only two days ago, Kubiak had zero reported interview invites. Now he is slated to interview for both the Steelers and Raiders’ head-coaching vacancies. Good for him. Kubiak’s offense has helped propel the 49ers into the Divisional Round, with the defense’s front-seven being hampered by injuries.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Mike Silver believes it is “untenable” for the Eagles to “stay the course” with WR A.J. Brown.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c8c6-dc7a-af9b-cfff56bb0000</link>
      <description>Silver notes that Brown’s talents are not being maximized. After this season, we tend to agree. Were the Eagles to trade him, though, it would create more than $72 million in dead money. Silver believes that “the team and potential suitors might need to find a more creative solution, such as a preemptively reworked contract.” Of course, hiring a brilliant offensive coordinator could always fix things. Brown’s discontent is well documented, but revamping roles may simply be the best and easiest fix.</description>

      <title>Cowboys will interview former Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon for their defensive coordinator vacancy on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-c926-d35e-a1bf-cde639e70000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Gannon had interviewed with the Cowboys earlier this week, ostensibly via video. The Cowboys are reportedly set to host two more in-person meetings, one with Eagles DB coach and pass game coordinator Christian Parker and the other with Vikings DB coach and pass game coordinator and Daronte Jones.</description>
