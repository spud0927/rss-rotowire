      <title>Titans will interview former Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9ff7-d56e-afff-ffff2bf20000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports that the interview will take place “next Saturday.” McCarthy worked with Titans president of football operations Chad Brinker during their time together with the Packers. Whether that gives McCarthy an edge remains to be seen. The Titans are casting a wide net. McCarthy will also interview for the Giants’ open role.</description>

      <title>Patriots C Garrett Bradbury (illness) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9ff7-d968-a19b-dff7a6e80000</link>
      <description>Patriots OLB Anfernee Jennings (illness) and OT Morgan Moses (illness) resumed practicing in full. Patriots OT Vederian Lowe (illness) remained sidelined, and did DT Khyiris Tonga (foot). All ill players have a chance to play in the Patriots’ Wild Card Round game against the Chargers.</description>

      <title>Patriots WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9fea-dc7a-af9b-dfff20b20000</link>
      <description>Mid-week additions to the injury report typically indicate that the player suffered a new injury in practice that day. We fear this is the case here. Boutte notably dealt with a hamstring strain earlier this season, costing him two games. He is not a big-time player in the Patriots’ offense, but he helps keep safeties honest in his field-stretching role.</description>

      <title>Falcons denied the Cowboys’ request to interview DC Jeff Ulbrich for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-a00a-d35e-a1bf-e5ca70760000</link>
      <description>Per ESPN’s Todd Archer, “a potential interview can be revisited later” if the Falcons hire a head coach “who has a different coordinator in mind.” One assumes that Falcons team owner Arthur Blank is pleased with Ulbrich’s performance last season. The defense cannot be described as an elite unit, but Ulbrich appears to be a respected figure in the organization.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-a014-dc7a-af9b-efbfff830000</link>
      <description>Pearsall is now on the wrong side of questionable for the 49ers’ Wild Card Round game against the Eagles. The 49ers’ talented route runner aggravated his PCL sprain in Week 17 against the Bears and was unable to play on it last week. It is possible that the team is just taking it easy with him, but things are not looking good.</description>

      <title>49ers TE George Kittle (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-a013-d56e-afff-e6fb75250000</link>
      <description>Kittle is on track to play, though it would be great to see him practice fully on Friday. The 49ers could be short-staffed when they face the Eagles this week. No. 1 WR Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) has not yet resumed practicing since aggravating the PCL sprain in his knee in Week 17.</description>

      <title>Cowboys requested to interview Broncos assistant head coach and defensive passing game coordinator Jim Leonhard for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-a017-d35e-a1bf-e5d7b53c0000</link>
      <description>Shortly before issuing this report, ESPN’s Todd Archer let it be known that the Falcons had denied the Cowboys’ request to interview DC Jeff Ulbirch. The Cowboys are smartly casting a very wide net to fill their vacant defensive coordinator role. Leonhard served as the Broncos’ DB coach and defensive passing game coordinator in 2024 before swapping out the DB coach role for an assistant head coach promotion in 2025.</description>

      <title>Cowboys requested to interview Vikings defensive pass game coordinator and DB coach Daronte Jones for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-a022-dc7a-af9b-efbf91df0000</link>
      <description>Jones was initially hired by the Vikings to coach only the defensive backs in 2022. They added defensive pass game coordinator to his title in 2023. ESPN’s Kevin Seifert believes Jones “would be on a very short list to replace Brian Flores as the Vikings’ defensive coordinator, if Flores departs.”</description>

      <title>Cowboys requested to interview Browns S coach Ephraim Banda for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-a022-dc7a-af9b-efbfcf880000</link>
      <description>Banda has coached the Browns’ safety group since the team brought him aboard in 2023. The unit stands out in a league that now frequently utilizes two-high safety looks. The Browns’ defense allowed the league’s ninth-fewest yards per pass play (6.61) despite Banda’s unit logging an NFL-high 773 defensive snaps with just one safety lined up deep this season.</description>

      <title>Jets requested to interview Vikings defensive pass game coordinator and DB coach Daronte Jones for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>

      <description>Jones now has two defensive coordinator interview requests. Good for him. He is also considered a candidate to replace Vikings DC Brian Flores, if were Flores to leave the Vikings’ organization for another opportunity.</description>
