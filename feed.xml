      <title>Packers RB Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle) was limited on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5246-d968-a19b-5af740ac0000</link>
      <description>While it would be great to see Jacobs practice fully, this is actually an improvement from last week. The Packers’ starting running back totaled just 48 scoreless yards after sitting out all three practices. He is on track to play in Week 17 against the Ravens, though RB Emanuel Wilson could continue to split backfield touches with him.</description>

      <title>Pat Bryant (concussion) will not play in Week 17 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-526a-d968-a19b-5afbc6c00000</link>
      <description>Bryant was taken off the field on a stretcher last week after taking a brutal hit while leaping for a Bo Nix pass. He was immediately sent to the hospital. Thankfully, they only diagnosed him with a concussion. Bryant could miss more than just Week 17, but a return for the playoffs is at least on the table. Troy Franklin will continue to operate as the team’s No. 2 for the final week of the fantasy football season. He will be a boom/bust WR3 versus a Chiefs squad that has all but given up on the season.</description>

      <title>A.J. Brown (teeth) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5203-d35e-a1bf-57c338060000</link>
      <description>As The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McClane points out, Brown told reporters yesterday that he was having his wisdom teeth removed this week. We would assume that won’t prevent him from suiting up on Sunday. Fantasy managers should still keep an eye on the Eagles’ injury report this week, just to be sure. As long as Brown is back at practice by Friday, he will be a high-ceiling WR2 in a potential shootout with the Bills.</description>

      <title>Chargers RB Kimani Vidal (neck) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-527d-d56e-afff-f6fd31c80000</link>
      <description>Two DNPs to open the week puts Vidal on the doubtful side of questionable. Fantasy managers can assume he will miss Week 17. Hassan Haskins took over RB2 duties last week after Vidal went down. He didn’t run any routes, meaning Omarion Hampton should get plenty of targets versus Houston, boosting him from the back of the RB2 ranks to just outside of the RB1 range.</description>

      <title>Dalton Schultz (knee) is practicing in full for Week 17 against the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5281-d56e-afff-f6e9ae730000</link>
      <description>Schultz was limited for Tuesday’s practice. That is standard fare for veterans this late in the year. A full practice today means he is good to go for Week 17. Schultz has finished as a TE1 in six of his past eight games. While his ceiling is relatively limited, he remains a high-floor TE1 bet for fantasy football championship week.</description>

      <title>Broncos LB Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) will not play in Week 17 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5286-d56e-afff-f6ee4f1c0000</link>
      <description>Greenlaw went down with a non-contact injury in Week 16 against the Jags. He did not return and it isn’t clear when he will be able to return. Greenlaw has 43 combined tackles, one interception, and one sack in eight games this season.</description>

      <title>Derek Stingley (oblique) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-528c-d56e-afff-f6ec00d10000</link>
      <description>Stingley has been playing through the oblique issue for a while. He was listed as questionable for Week 16, but, per usual, was on the field come Sunday. He was held out of yesterday’s practice, though that’s just load management at this point. Kamari Lassiter was also out of practice on Tuesday. Like Stingley, he returned today and should be good to go for Week 17.</description>

      <title>Maxx Crosby (knee) did not practice Wednedsay.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-528f-d56e-afff-f6ef5f7f0000</link>
      <description>Crosby has been playing through the knee issue for a while. A DNP for the first practice of the week is nothing new for him. Even with the Raiders fighting for the No. 1 overall pick on Sunday, we fully expect Crosby to suit up. Crosby has 10 sacks, two forced fumbles, and one interception this year.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-528f-d56e-afff-f6ef5f7f0000</guid>

      <title>Raiders RB Raheem Mostert (knee/ankle) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-529b-d968-a19b-5afb09670000</link>
      <description>Mostert has been mostly a kick returner this season, getting just 22 carries for 104 yards and 12 receptions for 70 yards on offense. He has returned 23 kicks for 673 yards and any potential absence this week would only have special teams impact. Mostert is dealing with knee and ankle issues and is in jeopardy of missing Week 17 against the Giants.</description>

      <title>Rams opened CB Roger McCreary’s 21-day practice window to be activated off injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-52a8-dc7a-af9b-dfbfab360000</link>
      <description>McCreary was acquired by the Rams in October, but has been sidelined on injured reserve due to a hip injury. The Rams designated him to return to practice, opening his 21-day window to be activated. Head coach Sean McVay also added that DB Quentin Lake’s practice window will likely be activated next week. McCreary and Lake will add reinforcements to the Rams secondary heading into the playoffs.</description>
