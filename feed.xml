      <title>James Cook practiced Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9e69-d45c-a7fc-9e7b762b0000</link>
      <description>Bills head coach Sean McDermott, meanwhile, said “things have changed” in Cook’s ongoing contract talks with the team. Tuesday would mark Cook’s first practice of training camp after he reported refused to play in last weekend’s preseason game against the Giants. It appears his hold-in is over — for now — and he could be on his way to starting Week 1 for the Bills. Cook is coming off an 18-touchdown season thanks to heavy red zone usage he did not see in his first two NFL seasons.</description>

      <title>Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said WR Darnell Mooney (shoulder) will play at some point in 2025.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9e84-df63-a199-dfaf956d0000</link>
      <description>Morris’ comments about the injured Mooney suggest the wideout could miss significant time in the regular season. “Kind of just waiting and rolling. Kind of a week-to-week basis,” Morris said of Mooney, who will miss training camp with his shoulder injury. “I feel good about getting him back healthy and ready to go. When? I don’t know. We’ll have him back healthy this year, though.” Mooney in 2024 was a mainstay in two-receiver sets and had 992 receiving yards and five touchdowns as Atlanta’s WR2. His absence would open more routes and targets for KhaDarel Hodge and Ray-Ray McCloud, the team’s primary slot receiver.</description>

      <title>Giants WR Malik Nabers (shoulder) did not practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9e89-d90d-a5bd-bedb1f4b0000</link>
      <description>Nabers said last week that it’s “part of the plan” for him to miss portions of Giants practice in the coming weeks as he deals with a shoulder issue. Jets beat writer Connor Hughes said Nabers’ Tuesday absence was “very noteworthy” and could be a sign that the star receiver is dealing with a significant injury. Hopefully Nabers can fully ramp up in the days before the team’s regular season opener against the Commanders. Last year, Nabers had 19 catches for 186 yards and one touchdown in two games against Washington.</description>

      <title>Jordan Love will undergo surgery on his left thumb.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9eab-d45c-a7fc-9ebb2cd70000</link>
      <description>The procedure will fix a ligament injury in Love’s non-throwing hand. The team hopes Love will be able to return to practice next week. “More importantly, he’ll be ready for Week 1, and that’s the most important thing,” said Packers general manager Brian Gutenkunst. “We’ll get him back in plenty of time. I don’t foresee this affecting him long term at all.” The oft-injured Love had expressed interest in running more in 2025. With the thumb issue, perhaps that’s off the table for now. Losing Love would be a massive blow for everyone in the Green Bay offense. Malik Willis would likely start for the Packers if Love misses any regular season time.</description>

      <title>Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said Christian Watson (knee) is likely to begin the regular season on the PUP list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9eb5-d90d-a5bd-beff8daf0000</link>
      <description>This confirms reporting from ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler that Watson, who suffered a torn ACL last January, will begin the year on PUP. Look for the Packers to ease Watson into the wideout rotation when he’s eligible for return from PUP. He could be a strictly situational downfield option for Jordan Love — who’s undergoing thumb surgery — with Matthew Golden reportedly emerging as Green Bay’s No. 1 wideout. Jayden Reed (foot) could also be iffy for the start of the regular season. The Packers offense is a banged-up unit.</description>

      <title>Texans TE Brevin Jordan (knee) is out for the season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9edd-df63-a199-dfff7c860000</link>
      <description>Jordan sustained a gut-wrenching knee injury during Monday’s practice. He was seen writhing and screaming on the ground for several minutes and Texans teammates appeared shaken up and emotional. Jordan was coming back from an ACL injury he sustained last year and was slated to be a regular part of the team’s tight end rotation. Now his NFL career could be in jeopardy.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Jets QB Tyrod Taylor underwent knee surgery.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f11-d90d-a5bd-bf5b4f330000</link>
      <description>The team hopes Taylor will be ready for Week 1, Rapoport said. The veteran journeyman was slated to serve as Justin Fields’ backup. If he’s sidelined for the start of the regular season, Adrian Martinez or Brady Cook would be Fields’ backup. Whoever serves as New York’s QB2, Fields’ starting gig won’t be nearly as precarious as it was last year in Pittsburgh, when he was benched for reasons never fully explained.</description>

      <title>Matthew Stafford (back) is not practicing on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f3c-df63-a199-df3f76760000</link>
      <description>The Ammortal Chamber awaits Stafford for another day, apparently. With every day that passes sans Stafford practicing, we get a little more concerned that he won’t be ready for the opener. Jimmy Garoppolo is Los Angeles’ backup quarterback. We’ll continue to monitor what Sean McVay called a “flexible and fluid” situation on Stafford’s back.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f3c-df63-a199-df3f76760000</guid>

      <title>Jets coach Aaron Glenn said Allen Lazard (shoulder) will “miss a couple of weeks.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f3f-d05a-adda-bfbf79790000</link>
      <description>Lazard was spotted in a sling after the Jets’ first preseason game and has, by most accounts, been lapped by Josh Reynolds in the Jets WR2 competition. This puts his Week 1 availability into question and an IR or PUP stint is probably not out of the question as well. Lazard does not need to be held unless you’re in a wildly deep league.</description>

      <title>Romeo Doubs (back) left Tuesday’s practice with trainers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-9f45-df63-a199-df6fc6110000</link>
      <description>He got medical attention after coming up with a deep ball, was crouched over for a few minutes, then walked off “holding” his lower back. It’s hard to speculate on what kind of injury may have happened here based on this information, but the Packers can ill-afford to lose Doubs as they’ve already been practicing without Dontayvion Wicks and Jayden Reed. It’s all coming up Matthew Golden right now for fantasy purposes. We’ll update Doubs’ status when the Packers do.</description>
