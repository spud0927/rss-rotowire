      <title>Broncos head coach Sean Payton said RB J.K. Dobbins (foot) “could return for the AFC Championship game if the team advances that far.”</title>

      <description>Nothing is imminent, but this is nice to hear. Initial reports indicated that Dobbins would be unable to return “before a potential Super Bowl LX appearance.” Dobbins also recently “told a fan” that he has a chance to return before that. The veteran running back suffered a Lisfranc injury against the Raiders in Week 10 via an illegal hip-drop tackle. Before suffering the injury, Dobbins had rushed 153 times for 772 yards and four touchdowns, while catching 11-of-14 targets for 37 yards this season.</description>

      <title>Alabama QB Ty Simpson declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9a88-dc7a-af9b-dfbfacc70000</link>
      <description>Simpson was named Alabama’s starter for 2025 after biding his time with the team from 2022-2024. In his final college season, he completed 275-of-419 passes for 3,282 yards, 27 touchdowns and four interceptions, while rushing 62 times for 282 yards and two touchdowns, earning second-team All-SEC honors.</description>

      <title>Eagles TE Dallas Goedert (knee) was limited on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9a90-d56e-afff-fef8cbfb0000</link>
      <description>Goedert is one of the Eagles’ starters who got the week off against the Commanders. He is on track to play against the 49ers this weekend, given his early-week participation. Although the Eagles may choose to employ a run-heavy approach, the 49ers’ injury-weakened linebacker corps profiles as a beatable matchup for Goedert.</description>

      <title>Eagles DT Jalen Carter (hip) was limited on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9aa4-dc7a-af9b-dfbfdc530000</link>
      <description>Eagles LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring) and S Marcus Epps (concussion) were limited as well. Carter and Dean are seemingly on track to play. Epps is best viewed as questionable at this time. The Eagles face the 49ers’ talented, yet somewhat banged-up offense on Sunday.</description>

      <title>Eagles TE Grant Calcaterra (ankle) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9abd-dc7a-af9b-dfbf145a0000</link>
      <description>Calcaterra left the Eagles’ Week 18 loss to the Commanders early after an unflagged hip drop tackle. The 27-year-old has operated as the Eagles’ primary backup tight end behind Dallas Goedert, who was limited in Wednesday’s practice. If Calcaterra cannot go for the Wild Card round against the 49ers, Kylen Granson figures to be the primary backup at tight end.</description>

      <title>Patriots C Garrett Bradbury (illness) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9ad7-d968-a19b-daf79b0e0000</link>
      <description>Bradbury joins OLB Anfernee Jennings, OT Vederian Lowe, and OT Morgan Moses as players out with illness on Wednesday. The only non-illness absence on the active roster for the Pats was DT Khyiris Tonga (foot). Sitting with illness this early in the week generally does not mean the players will miss the game, but it is certainly a situation to keep an eye on for the Pats’ offensive line heading into the Wild Card round against the Chargers. Tonga is a key run stuffer that will have a couple more chances to practice ahead of Sunday’s game.</description>

      <title>FOX Sports’ Ralph Vacchiano reports that nine teams have contacted former Ravens head coach John Harbaugh about vacant and occupied head-coaching roles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9acc-d56e-afff-feec34cc0000</link>
      <description>Among the nine, only six teams actually have head-coaching vacancies at this time. The six teams in reference are the Giants, Titans, Falcons, Raiders, Browns and Cardinals. Regarding the remaining three, according to Vacchiano, “speculation around the league seems to have centered” on the Dolphins, Packers and Panthers. Last we heard, “signs continue to point towards Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel returning next season.” Packers head coach Matt LaFleur is preparing his team for their third straight trip to the postseason, but “there has been an eerie feeling around the league that he might need to win a first-round game to be completely safe.” The Panthers are widely viewed as this year’s weakest playoff team, and owner David Tepper “is always a threat to swing again.” The Buccaneers were also thought to be in the mix before it was made known that head coach Todd Bowles is keeping his job for 2026.</description>

      <title>Chargers WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9add-d56e-afff-fefd673c0000</link>
      <description>Lambert-Smith left the Chargers’ Week 18 game against the Broncos with an apparent hamstring injury and now starts out the week not practicing. The rookie 23-year-old is low on the pass-catching depth chart and finished the 2025 regular season with five receptions for 51 yards and a touchdown. Lambert-Smith’s absence on kick returns will have more of an impact if he cannot go in the Wild Card against the Patriots.</description>

      <title>Chargers QB Justin Herbert (hand) is practicing fully for the Wild Card Round against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9ae0-d56e-afff-fee888cc0000</link>
      <description>Herbert sat out in Week 18. He told reporters that he took snaps under center today, which is “the earliest he’s done that in any game week” since suffering the injury in Week 13. Taking the week off seems to have helped in his recovery. Herbert should be good to go for his team’s game against the Patriots on Sunday.</description>

      <title>Rams TE Terrance Ferguson (hamstring) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9ae6-dc7a-af9b-dfffa3720000</link>
      <description>Ferguson followed up his Tuesday DNP with another DNP on Wednesday. WR Jordan Whittington (knee) and OL Kevin Dotson (ankle) also remained out. Official injury statuses will come out on Thursday but all three players are on the wrong side of questionable for the Wild Card round against the Panthers.</description>
