      <title>49ers WR Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) was limited on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-719e-d56e-afff-f7fe22ad0000</link>
      <description>The 49ers are hosting only a walkthrough this evening. Logging a limited session is a plus for Pearsall, who has been plagued by lower-body injuries this season. He looked great running routes against the Bears last week, and can be treated as a WR3 with upside against the Seahawks’ tough defense in Week 18.</description>

      <title>49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said LT Trent Williams (hamstring) has “a chance to play” in Week 18 against the Seahawks.</title>

      <description>Williams will not participate in the 49ers’ walkthrough this evening and was forced from Week 17 after just one snap. Consider him firmly in the questionable camp for the team’s divisional showdown against the Seahawks in Week 18.</description>

      <title>The Vikings are “working on a new deal” with DC Brian Flores.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-71a2-d968-a19b-79f36c430000</link>
      <description>As things currently stand, we are “two weeks from the open market.” Two weeks is a short time period, but things can move quickly in the NFL. Just yesterday, Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio reported that “various high-level executives” believe Flores will “most likely be a candidate” for a head-coaching job this offseason. The Vikings would surely love to keep their brilliant defensive coordinator, who schemes up bamboozling blitzes on a weekly basis. The Vikings’ 62.8 percent blitz rate leads the league by 19.9 percent and their 44.3 percent QB pressure rate leads the league by 2.0 percent.</description>

      <title>Seahawks TE AJ Barner (elbow/hip) is practicing fully for Week 18 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7235-d35e-a1bf-77f73b180000</link>
      <description>The Seahawks face the 49ers on Saturday. The winner secures both wins the NFC West and earns the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Barner has developed into a reliable contributor in the Seahawks’ passing game despite playing through multiple injuries this year. He is a boom-bust TE1 for the occasion.</description>

      <title>Seahawks WR Rashid Shaheed (concussion) was limited on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-71c2-d35e-a1bf-75c29bd90000</link>
      <description>This is a positive update for Shaheed, who was forced from last week’s game against the Panthers. The Seahawks face the 49ers on Saturday, and the winner takes home the NFC West crown while also securing the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Having Shaheed on the field would be extremely helpful for Seahawks QB Sam Darnold.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Ravens QB Lamar Jackson (back) is expected to practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74aa-d35e-a1bf-75ea354a0000</link>
      <description>Jackson missed Week 17’s matchup with the Packers after suffering a back contusion against the Patriots in the previous week. While the 28-year-old quarterback’s absence was unfortunate for fantasy managers in the championship round of the playoffs, the Ravens still beat the Packers without Jackson, setting up a winner-take-all date with the Steelers this week. Rapoport said the Ravens thought Jackson would play last week, but he wasn’t even able to practice. He’s expected back on the practice field Wednesday and it’s difficult to imagine him missing a game of this magnitude without a setback.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel “would be a candidate in Cleveland, should the Dolphins move on and Cleveland’s job open.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74b6-d968-a19b-7cf793ad0000</link>
      <description>10 days ago, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported McDaniel is expected to be back with the Dolphins. Fowler isn’t as sure, stating that while McDaniel has some support there, the team’s search for a new GM will be more about finding the best fit for the team rather than the best fit with McDaniel. Fowler even floats the idea that the Browns coaching position could come open by the team trading Kevin Stefanski to the Giants. While it’s all rumors and conjecture for now, the NFL’s coaching cycle will be in full force shortly after the final week of the regular season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Browns HC Kevin Stefanski would be an ideal fit with the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74c2-d968-a19b-7cf3bb530000</link>
      <description>Fowler reported earlier this week that the Browns have done preliminary research on a coaching change. Now the NFL Insider believes Stefanski would be an ideal fit for the Giants. The 43-year-old Browns coach is still under contract and Fowler floats the possibility that the team could trade him to the Giants, rather than fire him. While it’s unclear what the Giants’ level of interest in Stefanski is, Notre Dame’s Marcus Freeman removed his name from consideration for the position earlier this week. Expect the NFL’s coaching cycle to heat up next week after the conclusion of the regular season.</description>

      <title>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McLane reports Eagles QB Jalen Hurts and most starters are expected to rest in Week 18 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74c8-dc7a-af9b-ffff53210000</link>
      <description>McLane’s report comes on the heels of a report from NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo Tuesday essentially saying the same thing. The Eagles could earn the No. 2 seed in the NFC with a win and a Bears loss to the Lions, but it appears they’ll try to move up with Tanner McKee under center rather than Hurts. For fantasy managers still playing for something in Week 18, McKee and Tank Bigsby would be the top waiver wire priorities.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Browns signed C Kingsley Eguakun off the Lions practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74fb-d35e-a1bf-75fb1f3c0000</link>
      <description>Eguakun is on his way to Cleveland just when it seemed like he got his foot in the door in Detroit. The 24-year-old center has been with the Lions organization for two years and was elevated to the active roster to start in place of the injured Graham Glasgow each of the last two weeks. Lions coach Dan Campbell told reporters after Week 16’s game against the Steelers that he was very encouraged by Eguakun’s performance. Curiously, the Lions didn’t sign him to the active roster themselves. After a subpar performance against the Vikings on Christmas Day, which included a bad snap that turned into a lost fumble, the Browns signed him as a depth piece.</description>
