      <title>Blake Corum rushed 14 times for 48 yards and a touchdown in the Rams’ Week 16 overtime loss to the Seahawks while adding one catch for 13 yards.</title>

      <description>Corum was heavily involved in the game plan, even with Kyren Williams getting 23 carries for 70 yards in the overtime defeat. The 25-year-old tailback has scored in each of the last four games, and it’s certainly helped make up for the fact that he’s a non-factor in the Rams’ passing attack. Corum should see a similar amount of touches in Week 17 against the Falcons, but expect a better yardage total against a front that isn’t nearly as good as Seattle’s.</description>

      <title>Xavier Smith caught both of his targets for 57 yards in the Rams’ Week 16 overtime loss to the Seahawks.</title>

      <description>Smith was wide open for a 48-yard connection with Matt Stafford to set up a score. The 28-year-old certainly has some speed, but even with Davante Adams not available, there just aren’t enough targets to make him fantasy relevant at this stage.</description>

      <title>Konata Mumpfield caught 3-of-8 targets for 40 yards in the Rams’ Week 16 overtime loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-34fe-d087-addf-b5feabce0000</link>
      <description>With Davante Adams out due to a hamstring injury, Mumpfield was given a chance to make some plays. He didn’t make enough of them, as Matthew Stafford just missed on a few connections with the seventh-round pick of this year’s draft. If Adams can’t go in Week 17 against the Falcons, Mumpfield will be in the conversation for fantasy relevance in that contest. If Adams can go, there’s not enough upside for consideration in redraft formats.</description>

      <title>Terrance Ferguson caught 3-of-4 targets for 33 yards and a touchdown in the Rams’ Week 16 overtime loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-34ff-dc7a-af9b-ffff8ddf0000</link>
      <description>Ferguson should have had a second touchdown, but an (incorrectly called) illegal downfield lineman wiped away a terrific catch in the back of the end zone on the Rams’ second drive. He was able to find the end zone late in the fourth for the rookies’ second career touchdown. Ferguson has long-term upside and finished with more catches than both Coby Parkinson (2/21) and Davis Allen (2/34), but he’s off the radar for the remainder of the regular season, including Week 17 against the Falcons.</description>

      <title>Cooper Kupp caught 3-of-4 targets for 39 yards in the Seahawks’ Week 16 overtime win over the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3500-da28-afbb-f57d788e0000</link>
      <description>The Seahawks tried to get Kupp a touchdown early against his former team on a gadget pass that had no shot of working. Late in the second quarter, Sam Darnold found him for what should have been a play to set up a score, but he fumbled the football for what ended up being a touchback for the Rams. He did catch a low throw from Darnold for a two-point conversion, and the 32-year-old showed he’s still capable of getting it done on a beautiful sideline catch for 21 yards in overtime to help set up the winning score. Kupp remains a desperation FLEX going forward, with his next chance to contribute coming against the Panthers in Week 17.</description>

      <title>Rasheed Shaheed didn’t catch his lone target while adding one rush for 31 yards in the Seahawks’ Week 16 overtime win over the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3501-da28-afbb-f57d9fea0000</link>
      <description>Shaheed didn’t make much of a contribution outside of an end-around to set up a score late in the game on offense, but he showed off his sensational returning skills by returning a punt for 58 yards for a score in the middle of the fourth quarter. It’s a disappointing receiving day after Shaheed had made real progress over the previous two contests, but at least the trip to the end zone helps compensate. Shaheed should be more involved in Week 17 against the Panthers.</description>

      <title>AJ Barner caught 4-of-6 targets for 49 yards and a touchdown in the Seahawks’ Week 16 overtime win over the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3502-da28-afbb-f57f53e60000</link>
      <description>Barner — not exactly known for his elite athleticism — made Kam Kitchens look silly on a wide-open touchdown connection with Sam Darnold in the fourth. The 23-year-old is the clear top tight end in the passing game with Elijah Arroyo unavailable, but it was the case even with Arroyo healthy. Barner will again be on the TE1 cusp for Week 17 against the Panthers.</description>

      <title>Tee Higgins (concussion) was seen warming up for Friday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3705-dc7a-af9b-ffbf19570000</link>
      <description>Higgins has been limited in the first two practices to start the week. He still needs to clear concussion protocol if he hopes to suit up for Week 16 against the Dolphins, but three-straight practices, even if in a limited capacity, suggest he’s trending toward a return. We should have the final word on his availability when the team releases its injury report later in the day.</description>

      <title>Jets HC Aaron Glenn said Garrett Wilson (knee) will not return this season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3772-da28-afbb-f77f2cf90000</link>
      <description>Glenn had been reluctant to say in recent weeks whether Wilson would return this season, but he has finally confirmed that his WR1 will be shut down for the remainder of the season. Wilson suffered a knee sprain in Week 6 against the Broncos and re-aggravated that same injury in Week 11. The Week 11 injury landed Wilson on injured reserve, meaning he wouldn’t be eligible to return until Week 15. With the Jets in the final weeks of another lost season, there was little reason to force Wilson back on the field and risk another injury. Wilson caught 36 passes for 395 yards and four touchdowns in the seven games he appeared in this season while averaging 8.4 targets per game. This will mark the first time in his four-year career that Wilson failed to go for 1,000 yards, but there’s little reason to believe he won’t be ready to bounce back next season. The Jets have a lot to figure out this offseason, especially at the quarterback position following the failed Justin Fields experiment. Despite the question marks in the team’s QB room, Wilson should profile as a high-upside WR2 in fantasy next season.</description>

      <title>Bills HC Sean McVay said Dalton Kincaid (knee) is trending toward playing in Week 16 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3784-d087-addf-b7f457df0000</link>
      <description>Speaking with the media on Friday, McVay said Kincaid will practice and confirmed the third-year tight end has not suffered any setbacks from the knee injury that has sidelined him for the first two practices of this week. Kincaid played through his knee injury in Week 15’s win over the Patriots, catching 3-of-4 targets for 34 yards. We’ll get a final update on his game status later in the day, but if Kincaid can play in Week 16, he’ll be on the TE1 radar.</description>
