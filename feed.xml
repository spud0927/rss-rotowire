      <title>Texans GM Nick Caserio said TE Cade Stover (knee) should be ready for the offseason program.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e1f1-d56e-afff-e7f9b1d40000</link>
      <description>Stover bent his knee backward while trying to reel in an off-target pass during the Texans’ Divisional Round loss to New England. He immediately clutched his knee and did not return after leaving the game. It looked like a catastrophic injury in real time. Fortunately, Caserio said he avoided a serious injury. Stover should be able to get in a normal offseason routine, barring any setbacks. The second-year tight end only appeared in nine games this season. He caught 12 passes for 76 yards. He also took on tush push duties for Houston, running four times for three yards and a pair of first downs in the regular season.</description>

      <title>The Raiders are “believed to be focusing on an offensive-minded head coach to pair with the likely No. 1 overall pick,” Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza.</title>

      <description>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz said Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak and Broncos pass game coordinator and QB coach Davis Webb have come up “a lot” as top candidates, while adding that Chargers DC Jesse Minter “has come up as well.” Schultz also notes that Raiders co-owner Tom Brady has been “calling a number of Seahawks games of late,” giving Kubiak repeated opportunities to audition for the role live in front of one of the Raiders’ top decision makers.</description>

      <title>49ers GM John Lynch said Brandon Aiyuk has “played his last snap as a Niner.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e21b-dc7a-af9b-efbfda390000</link>
      <description>This was presumed to be the case when the 49ers put Aiyuk on the reserve/left squad list. It’s still stunning to hear about a player who signed a four-year, $120 million contract one season. San Francisco voided future guarantees in Aiyuk’s deal after he failed to meet certain contractual obligations. That should make it relatively easy for the team to release at some point in the offseason. He will be free to sign with any team, though the San Francisco fiasco will cost him an absurd amount of money in the long-run. NFL insiders have tabbed the Commanders and Steelers as potential landing spots for the mercurial wideout.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports that Jaguars OC Grant Udinski is a finalist for the Browns’ head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e200-dc7a-af9b-efbfd2220000</link>
      <description>Schultz also said that there is “a good chance they add another name or two to the mix” and described the situation as “very fluid,” which seemingly runs counter to Udinski’s “finalist” label. Regardless, the Browns reportedly prefer to hire a young head coach. Udinski, 30, will have his second interview with the team on Friday.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports that Rams pass game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase is a finalist for the Browns’ head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e22f-d968-a19b-faff2f3d0000</link>
      <description>Schultz notes that the situation is “very fluid” and that there is “a good chance they add another name or two to the mix.” Scheelhaase will reportedly have his second interview with the team next week. The Browns are said to be targeting a young head coach. Scheelhaase, 35, fits the bill.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports that the Browns hope to retain DC Jim Schwartz in his current role.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e23c-dc7a-af9b-efbf78160000</link>
      <description>It sounds like he is no longer a candidate for their head-coaching vacancy. The Browns are said to be targeting a young candidate for the role, though Schultz notes that the team is not sure how Schartz would “react” to such a hire. The Browns have a win-now defense. It is possible that Schwartz is not interested in waiting around to see if an unproven candidate pans out.</description>

      <title>49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said he would be “very surprised” if Mac Jones isn’t on the team next year.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e23b-d968-a19b-fafb06c70000</link>
      <description>Jones went 5-3 as the 49ers’ starter while Brock Purdy was out with a foot injury. He finished the regular season ranked 10th in EPA per play. He is a great backup for Shanahan’s system, but the 49ers could also get a haul in return for Jones on the trade market. Both the free agent pool and the draft class are thin at quarterback, and plenty of teams will need one this offseason. With one year left on his current deal, a desperate team would likely send a Day Two pick to San Francisco for Jones’s services. For now, it looks like the team will keep him in the fold, but that could change once offers start rolling in.</description>

      <title>Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said RB George Holani (hamstring) is “readying” himself for the “role behind” RB Kenneth Walker.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e241-d56e-afff-e6e948570000</link>
      <description>Macdonald’s phrasing suggests Holani, not RB Cam Akers nor RB Velus Jones, would operate as the team’s No. 2 running back behind Walker, with former No. 2 RB Zach Charbonnet sidelined by a season-ending ACL tear. Macdonald adds that it is “realistic” for Holani to play this week. He has a chance to take on pass-protection duties while chipping in as a rotational ballcarrier.</description>

      <title>Eagles interviewed Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e243-d35e-a1bf-e7c3841f0000</link>
      <description>Per NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo, Nagy is exploring a few OC openings. In other words, none of the head coaching interviews worked out. That dream died when the Titans passed on him in favor of Robert Saleh. With his contract in Kansas City up and Eric Bieniemy expected to fill that role, Nagy is now on the search for a new OC gig. The Eagles are in desperate need of a creative coordinator to invigorate their stagnant offense, but it’s hard to see Nagy as the man for the job. He just coached Patrick Mahomes for three seasons and failed to finish better than 15th in points scored.</description>

      <title>Falcons requested an interview with Chiefs assistant general manager Mike Bradway for their general manager vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-e254-d56e-afff-e6fcd65f0000</link>
      <description>Bradway served as the Chiefs’ assistant director of player personnel from 2018-2020. He was promoted to the senior director of player personnel in 2021 and promoted again, to his current role, last offseason. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport refers to Bradway as “a top lieutenant” to general managers Brett Veach and believes Bradway “is next in a line of top KC personnel minds to explore a big job.”</description>
