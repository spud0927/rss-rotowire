      <title>Jaguards declared LB Devin Lloyd, S Kahlef Hailassie, RB Cody Schrader, OL Wyatt Milum, TE Quintin Morris, and DT Khalen Saunders Sr. inactive for Week 7 against the Rams.</title>

      <description>No surprises here as Lloyd and Morris were the only players with injury statuses heading into this game. Both players were ruled out on Friday and did not travel to London. Lloyd has been a star for the Jags this year with four interceptions and one pick-six. His loss will free up space for the Rams to work over the middle of the field.</description>

      <title>Rams declared RB Jarquez Hunter, WR Puka Nacua, OG Beaux Limmer, RT Rob Havenstein, and DE Desjuan Johnson inactive for Week 7 against the Jaguars.</title>

      <description>Nacua will get a Week 8 bye to rest up before eying a Week 9 return against the Saints. Hunter is back to being a healthy scratch after getting some work on special teams over the past month. He hasn’t earned a snap on offense this year.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Josh Jacobs (calf/illness) is a “true game-time decision” for Week 7 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-fc69-da18-a39b-fe7b9f170000</link>
      <description>Jacobs was limited in practice on Wednesday and Thursday with the illness. He was then upgraded to a full practice on Friday, but the team added the calf injury to his practice report and listed him as questionable. Full participants almost always suit up on Sunday, but the calf injury is likely more serious than initially expected. Schefter notes that Emanuel Wilson would draw the start if Jacobs is ruled out. Fantasy managers may want to add him as a contingency option should Jacobs be ruled out later today.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Kyler Murray (foot) is expected to return after the Cardinals’ Week 8 bye.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-fc6d-df81-ab9b-feefac470000</link>
      <description>While technically listed as questionable for Week 7, all signs point to Murray sitting another week while he recovers from the foot injury. Jacoby Brissett is expected to make his second start. Brissett was more aggressive than Kyler with a 10.6 aDOT in Week 6. That fueled Zay Jones and Tre McBride to 70-yard games and Brissett himself went for 320 yards and two scores. The Cardinals still lost to the Colts, but Brissett at least gives his wideouts a chance for more splash plays. With Brissett in the lineup. Marvin Harrison Jr. will eye WR2 numbers after a rocky start to the year.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Jakobi Meyers (knee/toe) will work out pre-game to determine his availability for Week 7 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-fc72-df81-ab9b-fef79e3c0000</link>
      <description>Meyers remains a game-time decision. If he misses, the Raiders will be down to Tre Tucker as their top pass-catcher. Brock Bowers is listed as doubtful and is not expected to play. Rookies Jack Bech and Dont’e Thornton will also be in line for more work if Meyers is ruled out. Tucker should be rostered in all fantasy formats while the rookies are deep-league flyers.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Brock Bowers (knee) is not expected to play in Week 7 against the Chiefs and has a “good chance to return after the bye.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-fc77-d99b-a1dd-fe7f4e740000</link>
      <description>Bowers was listed as doubtful heading into the weekend, so his absence isn’t a surprise. The Raiders get their bye in Week 8, giving Bowers a month of rest between his last game and a potential Week 9 return versus the Jaguars. Michael Mayer will take his place in the lineup for now. Mayers is a streaming TE2 for his date with Kansas City.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Jalen Carter (heel) is expected to play in Week 7 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-fc7d-d99b-a1dd-fe7d27c40000</link>
      <description>Carter practiced in full on Wednesday but was downgraded to limited sessions on the following two days before being listed as questionable. The team was likely managing his reps closely to ensure the injury didn’t get worse. Carter has had a quiet start to the year with one TFL, seven total tackles, and no sacks. A date with Carson Wentz will give him a good chance to get on the board.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Stefon Diggs (chest) is expected to play in Week 7 against the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-fc80-da18-a39b-fe93e5570000</link>
      <description>Diggs was a full participant in Friday’s practice, but the team still played things safe and listed him as questionable. He never seemed at much risk of missing Week 7. The injury, however, will likely prevent him from playing every snap, something the Patriots have been hesitant to do with their veteran wideout this year. Even with a limited route rate, Diggs is a WR2 for his Week 7 bout with the Titans.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Titans are expected to “simplify their offense” for Cam Ward.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-fc84-df81-ab9b-fec7b1140000</link>
      <description>The Titans fired Brian Callahan last week and replaced him with senior offensive assistant Mike McCoy as the interim head coach. Callahan’s offense wasn’t necessarily known for its abundance of bells and whistles, but Ward is at his best when given the opportunity to freelance, even if that can also get him in trouble. The hope will be that a simpler offense lets him execute the basics well while giving him the freedom to make plays when needed. For fantasy purposes, managers can give Ward a few weeks before considering him as a streaming option.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports D’Andre Swift (groin) is expected to play in Week 7 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-fc8c-d99b-a1dd-fe8c117e0000</link>
      <description>Rapoport notes Bears DT Grady Jarrett (knee) is also expected to play. Swift was a full participant in Wednesday’s practice before being downgraded to limited sessions on the following two days. The team then listed him as questionable. Swift told reporters after Friday’s practice that the limited days were simply maintenance. He has been dealing with a myriad of injuries this year but has yet to miss any time. Swift should get plenty of work as a home favorite versus the Saints this week, vaulting him up the RB2 ranks.</description>
