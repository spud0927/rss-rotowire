      <title>Savion Williams (foot) did not practice Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b7c3-d413-ad9f-b7df07850000</link>
      <description>He played through the foot listing last week, generating zero yards on his lone touch. Non-dynasty managers don’t have to worry about Williams this season between his lack of progress and Green Bay’s lack of interest in throwing.</description>

      <title>Packers WR Jayden Reed (foot/shoulder) was limited in Monday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b7c4-d413-ad9f-b7dd53a30000</link>
      <description>We’re not expecting the Packers to activate Reed ahead of Thanksgiving’s date with the Lions, but it’s also not completely off the table after limited sessions on Friday of last week and this estimation here. If Reed did play, the long layoff and likely snap count would render him a hard-to-trust option in fantasy leagues.</description>

      <title>Packers listed Josh Jacobs (knee) as limited on Monday’s estimated practice report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b7c3-d82c-a79a-b7d7c72b0000</link>
      <description>Jacobs fought to play in Week 12’s game against the Vikings but was ultimately scratched before kickoff. The veteran running back said last week that he was hoping to miss only one game at most, so it’s safe to assume he’s trending in the right direction for Thursday’s game against the Lions. We’ll continue to monitor him throughout the week, but if Jacobs unable to go, Emanuel Wilson will be a volume-based RB2.</description>

      <title>Packers listed Matthew Golden (wrist) as limited on Monday’s estimated practice report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b7c6-d90e-a9da-bfcfe5120000</link>
      <description>Golden didn’t play in Week 12’s game against the Vikings despite being listed as a limited participant all week. Even if he is able to suit up for this week’s game against the Lions, Golden has totaled just six catches for 37 yards and no touchdowns in his last three games. Whether he’s active or not, fantasy managers can pass on Golden in Week 13.</description>

      <title>Bengals RB Samaje Perine (ankle) practiced in full on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b7cd-db57-afda-f7ffe02f0000</link>
      <description>It’s an estimation, but it’s a rapid recovery from Perine after being doubtful for Week 12. Perine left Week 9 against the Bears with a high-ankle sprain and has not played since. His return would prevent Chase Brown from hogging the whole workload pie against the Ravens, much to the chagrin of Brown-reliant managers.</description>

      <title>Bengals QB Joe Burrow is practicing in full for Week 13’s game against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b7d1-d82c-a79a-b7d59a0e0000</link>
      <description>Burrow has all but announced on Instagram that he’ll be back, Zac Taylor couldn’t bring himself to say the words but we all know what is implied in “anticipating” a return. Burrow will almost certainly start against the Ravens and return to the QB1 line while Joe Flacco (shoulder/finger, limited) heads back to the bench on Thursday.</description>

      <title>Cardinals HC Jonathan Gannon did not have an update on Marvin Harrison Jr. (appendicitis) to start the week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b7cb-db57-afda-f7fbe71a0000</link>
      <description>The Cardinals wasted little time ruling out Harrison for last week’s game against the Jaguars. Harrison has now missed back-to-back games since undergoing surgery for appendicitis ahead of Week 11, and could be at risk of missing Week 13’s game against the Buccaneers. We might have to wait until Wednesday’s injury report to see where things stand, but another absence for MHJ would be music to the ears of fantasy managers rostering Michael Wilson. Since Harrison has been sidelined, Wilson has caught 25 passes for 303 yards. He would be a must-start against the Bucs if MHJ sits.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports an MRI revealed a low-grade sprain to Baker Mayfield’s shoulder.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b7fc-d413-ad9f-b7fdab2b0000</link>
      <description>Rapoport notes that this is “good news with an eye toward next week,” suggesting Mayfield could miss at least one game with the injury. We’ll see if this changes throughout the week, but if Mayfield is unable to go against the Cardinals, Teddy Bridgewater would draw the start in his absence. Bridgewater threw for just 62 yards on 15 pass attempts in last week’s loss to the Rams, and would be an immediate downgrade for all Buccaneers pass-catchers. Mayfield’s status will be one to monitor when the first practice report drops on Wednesday.</description>

      <title>Ravens HC John Harbaugh said Lamar Jackson is fine physically after Week 12’s win over the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b80e-d413-ad9f-bddf4cc70000</link>
      <description>Jackson appeared a step slower in Sunday’s win over the Jets, but shut down any idea that injuries have held him back in recent weeks. Jackson hasn’t rushed for more than 36 yards in a game since returning from the hamstring injury he suffered in Week 4, and is averaging just 2.8 yards per carry in his last four games. Jackson and Harbaugh can deny it all they want, but it’s hard to ignore one of the most dynamic runners in the league suddenly looking far less dynamic. Hopefully this is something he can work through while still playing, but fantasy managers banking on Jackson’s rushing upside carrying them into and through the fantasy playoffs in the coming weeks may need to temper expectations a bit.</description>

      <title>Ravens HC John Harbaugh said Kyle Hamilton (ankle) will “have a chance” to play in Week 13 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-b816-d90e-a9da-bf1fd2380000</link>
      <description>Hamilton was already playing through a shoulder injury entering Week 12, and was knocked from Sunday’s win over the Jets with an ankle injury that he suffered after slipping on the turf. Hamilton is one of the premier defenders in the league and would make for a massive loss if the Ravens are without him against Joe Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase, and the Bengals.</description>
