      <title>Patriots designated RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-be87-d968-a19b-fef7c0ac0000</link>
      <description>Jennings landed on injured reserve after suffering a concussion back in December. He handled short-yardage rushing duties from roughly Weeks 7-10, but burly RB Rhamondre Stevenson and rookie RB TreVeyon Henderson have seemingly established themselves as a reliable duo for head coach Mike Vrabel. Jennings is a nice backup to have active on game day, though. Jennings was limited on Wednesday.</description>

      <title>Bears WR DJ Moore (knee) was limited on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bea5-dc7a-af9b-ffbffde50000</link>
      <description>Moore played through the knee injury last week, catching 6-of-7 targets for 64 yards and one touchdown in the Bears’ Wild Card win over the Packers. We expect him to be good to go for the Bears’ Divisional Round game against the Rams. The Bears’ passing results can be somewhat game script-dependent. We like the odds of a high-scoring game developing this weekend, as two talented offenses meet.</description>

      <title>Bears WR Rome Odunze (foot) was limited on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-be76-dc7a-af9b-ffff68170000</link>
      <description>Odunze was a bit rusty last week, but he appears to have made it through the game without suffering a setback. The Bears face the Rams’ explosive offense in the Divisional Round on Sunday, which should result in a fantasy-friendly game script.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports the Titans interview former Ravens head coach John Harbaugh on Thursday for their head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bea5-dc7a-af9b-ffbfbc0a0000</link>
      <description>The Giants reportedly made a “massive push” to get Harbaugh to sign with them today. Of note, Harbaugh met with the Giants at their facility, toured the grounds, and even met with Jaxson Dart today. The Titans, on the other hand, are meeting him at his home. While it does seem like the Giants are in pole position to land the cycle’s hottest name, Harbaugh is still going to talk to the Titans. He will likely meet with Atlanta before making a decision as well.</description>

      <title>Bears OL Braxton Jones (knee) is practicing fully for Chicago’s Divisional Round game against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-beac-d35e-a1bf-ffee6e910000</link>
      <description>Starting LT Ozzy Trapilo ruptured his patellar tendon in the Bears’ Wild Card win over the Packers, ending his season. Jones has not yet been officially activated from injured reserve, but his full practice participation is a good sign. If activated, he will compete with OL Theo Benedet, who manned the left tackle spot earlier this season.</description>

      <title>Rams TE Terrance Ferguson (hamstring) was a full participant in Wednesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bec5-dc7a-af9b-ffff48000000</link>
      <description>Ferguson missed the Wild Card win over the Panthers with a hamstring injury, but head coach Sean McVay was optimistic the rookie would play this week. Though Wednesday’s practice report is an estimate, it is good news that Ferguson is listed as a full participant. The Rams are trending to get their full tight end room back for the Sunday Divisional matchup against the Bears.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Ricky Pearsall (knee) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-becd-d968-a19b-fefd3bfd0000</link>
      <description>Pearsall is listed as limited for the second straight day to start the week. He missed the 49ers’ Wild Card win over the Eagles and has dealt with knee issues throughout the season. Thursday’s final practice report will give a more concrete answer but Pearsall is at least practicing and trending to return in the Divisional Round against the Seahawks.</description>

      <title>Seahawks LT Charles Cross (hamstring/knee) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bed0-d968-a19b-fef1b6170000</link>
      <description>Despite practicing fully on Tuesday coming off a hamstring injury, Cross is downgraded to limited Wednesday with a new knee issue to deal with it. Thursday’s practice will have the final report on how serious Cross’ issues are, but the new listing indicates he suffered the knee injury in practice. Seahawks fans can check back later in the week to see if the franchise left tackle will be good to go for Saturday’s Divisional matchup against the 49ers.</description>

      <title>Texans RB Jawhar Jordan (ankle) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bee2-dc7a-af9b-ffff7eed0000</link>
      <description>Jordan suffered an ankle injury in Week 18 which caused him to miss the Wild Card win over the Steelers. The 26-year-old played well in a reserve role and was the Texans’ RB2 in Week 18 with Nick Chubb a healthy scratch. A limited practice session early in the week indicates Jordan is trending to return in the Divisional Round against the Patriots, though the Texans may keep both Jordan and Chubb active behind Woody Marks if Jordan is not fully healthy.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Josina Anderson reports the Cowboys have requested to interview Packers defensive line coach DeMarcus Covington for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-beee-d968-a19b-feff52390000</link>
      <description>Covington joined the Packers as defensive line coach prior to the 2025 season. The Packers were middle-of-the-pack in both sacks and rushing yards allowed and boasted a defensive line of Micah Parsons, Rashan Gary, and more. Green Bay was able to generate pressure under Covington, though Parsons’ late-season ACL tear stymied the pass rush. The Cowboys parted ways with Matt Eberflus after the season and are interviewing candidates for the defensive coordinator role. Covington is next up on the interview list.</description>
