      <title>Chiefs WR Rashee Rice (hamstring) is expected to practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bc38-db57-afda-fe3aab6c0000</link>
      <description>He’ll likely be headed for a limited session, but this should quell the panic that he might miss the game against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. Rice is coming off a 8/141 game on 12 targets against the Colts and should be a set-it, forget-it WR1 in Week 13 as long as he plays and no dire reporting emerges about the hamstring.</description>

      <title>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer believes the 49ers could get “a Day 2 pick in 2026 and maybe a conditional Day 3 pick in 2027" for Mac Jones this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bc47-d90e-a9da-bf4fb2d70000</link>
      <description>The rub is that Jones is under contract for just $4.66 million in 2026, so a team trading for him at that number can afford to do quite a bit of maneuvering with the cap. Breer lists the Vikings, Dolphins, and Cardinals as teams that could potentially look at Jones this offseason. The Vikings scenario makes all the sense in the world considering Jones would be able to send McCarthy to the bench barring drastic offseason improvement from the second-year signal caller. Jones has thrown for 2151 yards with 13 touchdowns and six interceptions while winning 5-of-8 starts with Brock Purdy sidelined this year.</description>

      <title>Lamar Jackson (toe) practiced on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bc50-d82c-a79a-bfd401110000</link>
      <description>This is the norm for Jackson now, he misses the first session of the week and practices in the second. While both Jackson and John Harbaugh have insisted he’s fine physically, it’s hard to see him looking a step slow and actually believe that. Regardless, Jackson-reliant managers are absolutely using Jackson in Week 13 against the league’s worst defense, Cincinnati. Even if he’s thrown for just one touchdown in the last three weeks.</description>

      <title>Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said George Pickens (knee/calf) will practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bc60-d82c-a79a-bff473930000</link>
      <description>Numerous beats have mentioned that they didn’t seem to think Pickens was laboring in the locker room after the game on Sunday, as he apparently played through this leg injury in the second half. This will probably be a limited session, but it sounds like Pickens is just getting some extra rest ahead of the Thanksgiving showdown with the Chiefs on Thursday.</description>

      <title>Cardinals OC Drew Petzing said that he’ll “continue to put [Michael Wilson] higher in the progression” even when Marvin Harrison Jr. returns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bc6b-d90e-a9da-bf6f69320000</link>
      <description>“When you produce in this league, we’re gonna give you more opportunities to continue to do that,” Petzing added. Wilson could cut into Harrison’s sure-fire role and create a triumvirate of playable pass-catchers in Arizona down the stretch between Trey McBride, Harrison, and Wilson. Don’t necessarily assume you need to drop Wilson once it’s confirmed Harrison is coming back — he could still be a viable WR3/FLEX going forward.</description>

      <title>Falcons coach Raheem Morris said the Michael Penix (knee) injury could force the Falcons to “make some different plans” this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bc74-d6c4-abfb-fe77580e0000</link>
      <description>With how late in the year Penix’s ACL injury happened, there’s not a guarantee that he’ll be ready for the start of the 2026 season. Of course, there’s also not a guarantee that Morris or GM Terry Fontenot survive what has been a calamitous season despite the fact that the Rams own their 2026 first-round pick. Releasing Kirk Cousins could free up $32.5 million in cap space. The Falcons don’t have much in the way of avenues out of Penix given the lack of a first-round pick and a lack of options beyond cutting Cousins to free up cap space, but they could prioritize a veteran backup if the current braintrust stays in place. If Morris and Fontenot are fired, Penix will not be the new regime’s hand-picked quarterback. The dynasty value of Penix is in a dicey situation as he tries to rehab his partial ACL tear.</description>

      <title>Chargers designated RB Omarion Hampton (ankle/IR) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bc9f-d82c-a79a-bf9f87b70000</link>
      <description>Harbaugh was quoted as saying “he’s excited for Hampton to ramp up” and said “we’ll see how the week goes” when asked about a carry split between Hampton and Kimani Vidal. Hampton’s 21-day window opening ahead of Week 13 means he should be available for Week 16 at the latest, but those quotes make it sound like a return this week is at least in the realm of possibility.</description>

      <title>Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Kyle Hamilton (shoulder) practiced in full on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcb0-d82c-a79a-bfb41c6b0000</link>
      <description>Hamilton looks on track to play Thursday despite being pulled from Baltimore’s Week 12 game against the Jets multiple times. The star safety is the straw that stirs Baltimore’s drink on defense and they’ll badly need him as they try to keep control of the AFC North with another win on Thursday.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcb0-d82c-a79a-bfb41c6b0000</guid>

      <title>Ravens WR Rashod Bateman (ankle) practiced in full on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcb3-d90e-a9da-bfbf17f20000</link>
      <description>The Ravens look likely to get their starting outside receiver back against the Bengals on Thanksgiving. There’s no reason to full send a Bateman recommendation with all 32 teams playing in Week 13, but if you’re in a deep enough league to consider it, a matchup against the league-worst Bengals defense certainly would be an understandable circumstance to start Bateman into.</description>

      <title>NFL suspended Panthers S Tre’Von Moehrig one game for punching 49ers WR Jauan Jennings in the groin on Monday night.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bcb9-d90e-a9da-bfbf5eb50000</link>
      <description>It will undoubtedly be appealed, but as Ja’Marr Chase learned last week, it’s hard to “get away” with something like this when there are thousands of cameras trained on every football field. Assuming it sticks, Moehrig will miss Week 13’s game against the Rams.</description>
