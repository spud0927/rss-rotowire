      <title>Bills K Matt Prater (quad/calf) did not participate in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-b9aa-d968-a19b-f9fb71e40000</link>
      <description>Prater was active for the Bills’ Wild Card game, sinking both of his field goal attempts in the victory. The 41-year-old has played through a few ailments this season and will likely do so again if he can. Prater was listed as DNP for the Bills’ walkthrough, dealing with quad and calf issues. Practice reports later in the week will tell if Prater will officially go in the Saturday Divisional matchup against the Broncos, otherwise Matthew Wright will be called up from the practice squad.</description>

      <title>Bills CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle) did not participate in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-b9b3-d35e-a1bf-fdf35a3f0000</link>
      <description>Hairston missed the Bills’ Wild Card victory with an ankle injury he suffered in Week 18. There are several defensive players listed as limited on the Bills’ practice report as well, though it is merely an estimation as the team held a walkthrough practice, so reports from later in the week will tell a more concrete story. Hairston will need to get some practice time in before the end of the week in order to have a chance at playing in the Divisional Round against the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Broncos DL John Franklin-Myers (hip) was a full participant in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-b9be-d968-a19b-f9ff3f670000</link>
      <description>The first-round bye gave Franklin-Myers an additional week to get healthy after he missed the Broncos’ Week 18 game. His full practice Tuesday is a good indication he will play in the Divisional Round against the Bills. LB Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) was also limited and could be nearing a return in the playoffs.</description>

      <title>Seahawks TE Elijah Arroyo (knee) was a full participant in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-b9c0-d56e-afff-ffe87f6f0000</link>
      <description>Arroyo was placed on injured reserve after suffering a knee injury in Week 14 but is nearing a return after a full practice on Tuesday. He was designated to return last week and looks to be in good shape to return to his rotational tight end role for the Divisional Round against the 49ers. With AJ Barner (hip) also fully practicing, the Seahawks tight end room is in good shape for the playoffs.</description>

      <title>Seahawks LT Charles Cross (hamstring) was a full participant in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-b9c7-d35e-a1bf-fdc7b3190000</link>
      <description>Cross (hamstring) was a key injury to keep an eye on heading into the playoffs, having not played since Week 15. The good news is he is practicing in full after the Seahawks’ first-round bye and is likely to go for the Divisional Round against the 49ers. Sam Darnold will have a better time in the pocket with Cross protecting his blind side.</description>

      <title>Oregon TE Kenyon Sadiq has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-b9cb-d35e-a1bf-fdcbf1ce0000</link>
      <description>Sadiq is declaring for the draft early and immediately becomes one of the top tight end prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft. The 20-year-old tallied 24 receptions for 308 yards and two touchdowns as a sophomore for an Oregon team that won the Big Ten Championship. He followed that up with a 51/560/8 line as a junior, leading all college tight ends in touchdown catches. Sadiq will get buzz as potentially the first tight end off the board and is a candidate to be selected in the top half of the first round.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports the Cardinals have requested to interview Texans defensive coordinator Matt Burke for their open head coaching role.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ba2e-d35e-a1bf-ffee76800000</link>
      <description>At the helm of the Texans defense with head coach DeMeco Ryans for the past three seasons, Burke has helped craft a hard-hitting, powerful defensive line and secondary. He took over defensive play-calling from Ryans towards the start of a season that saw the Texans allow the least yards and second-least points of any team in the NFL, while ranking top-seven in both sacks and interceptions. The Cardinals just moved off a defensive head coach and are now looking to interview another one, requesting an interview with Burke fresh off a two-touchdown defensive performance in the Wild Card Round.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports the Giants, Titans, and Falcons “appear to have the inside track” on hiring John Harbaugh for head coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-baa2-d35e-a1bf-ffe2194a0000</link>
      <description>Harbaugh gave his first interview with the Falcons on Monday after reports the Giants and Titans were also in the mix. Though other teams are interested and pretty much all teams have called, Harbaugh is prioritizing the head coaching vacancies for the Giants, Titans, and Falcons. Pelissero reports he is expected to interview with all three teams by the end of the week. The Falcons have the two oldest starting quarterbacks among the three teams, while Cam Ward and Jaxson Dart are both first-round picks entering their sophomore seasons. The former Ravens head coach is narrowing his options as he gets closer to a decision.</description>

      <title>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s David Murphy believes former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel is the “perfect” offensive coordinator candidate for the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bca6-d56e-afff-feeeeb9e0000</link>
      <description>After firing offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo following a mostly disastrous 2025 season, the Eagles should seek “a fresh set of eyes” to reevaluate the Philly offense and how it utilizes its skill position players, Murphy said. McDaniel, who designed and called plays for a Miami offense that ranked among the NFL’s most efficient from 2022 to 2024 — before the team’s 2025 collapse. Eagles players, including DeVonta Smith, said after the team’s Wild Card loss to the 49ers that the offensive scheme had not changed at all in recent years despite the Eagles shuffling through offensive coordinators. That suggests the problem lies with head coach Nick Sirianni. “Howie Roseman and Jeffrey Lurie pride themselves on being ahead of the curve. They’d rather be a year early than a year late,” Murphy said. “Right now, it is getting late early. McDaniel or not, they need a new voice, an inventive mind, and a fresh set of eyes. Anybody else will end up right where Patullo is. And that’s not fair to anybody.”</description>

      <title>Titans interviewed Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bcfb-dc7a-af9b-ffff911f0000</link>
      <description>Though Smith technically remains the Steelers OC, he’ll be elsewhere in 2026 after head coach Mike Tomlin stepped down on Tuesday afternoon. Smith served as Tennessee’s offensive coordinator from 2019 to 2020, creating a dominant run-heavy offense quarterbacked by Ryan Tannehill. If the Titans bring back Smith as the team’s head coach, he would likely install a similarly run-first offense around QB Cam Ward. Probably it wouldn’t be a great development for Ward’s fantasy prospects in 2026 and beyond. Smith’s Steelers offense in 2025 ranked 18th in EPA per play. They had the league’s sixth highest rushing success rate.</description>
