      <title>Kameron Johnson caught 4-of-4 targets for 64 yards and a touchdown in the Buccaneers’ Week 6 win over the 49ers.</title>

      <description>Sure. Johnson, a 2024 UDFA from “Barton College” (not making this up) had just one target in 10 games in his NFL career before today. He was lost coming across the formation on his touchdown strike of 34 yards that came late in the first half, and added the other 30 yards on a pair of second-and-long strikes as the Buccaneers successfully navigated their way to a late field goal to push their lead to two scores. He essentially played in relief for Emeka Egubka, picking up 25 snaps to Egbuka’s 28. None of his work in the regular season — heck, none of his work in the preseason — would forecast anything near this ever happening. Fluke game or future $1 waiver wire league winner? We’d lean more towards fluke. But if we don’t have better news on Egbuka, Mike Evans, or Chris Godwin by your league’s waiver deadline, Johnson might be worth a roll against the Lions on Monday night.</description>

      <title>Jared Goff completed 23-of-29 passes for 203 yards and two touchdowns in the Lions’ 30-17, Week 6 loss to the Chiefs, adding seven yards on one carry.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-db87-dd4c-afb9-ffc73ecd0000</link>
      <description>Goff did not throw an incompletion in the second half until the team’s final drive of the game, throwing three consecutive incompletions to turn the ball over on downs and give the Chiefs a hard-fought victory. Even so, the Lions were stuck in game where they were unable to play with a lead throughout for only the second time this season, and both the Chiefs and Packers have now targeted slight kinks in the armor in Detroit through six weeks by forcing them into more one-dimensional offensive structures. Goff has proven to be more than capable of sustaining drives and marching the field, but we’ve seen him struggle if forced into clear passing, must-have situations the previous three seasons. The 4-2 Lions host the Buccaneers in Week 7 before their Week 8 bye.</description>

      <title>Jahmyr Gibbs rushed 17 times for 65 yards in the Lions’ Week 6 loss to the Chiefs, catching one pass for zero yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-db99-def2-abdb-dff9fd260000</link>
      <description>Gibbs significantly out-touched backfield mate David Montgomery, the latter of whom turned four carries into 24 yards and caught two targets for 37 yards through the air. The large disparity in backfield work was likely resultant from consistently negative game script after the Lions trailed for much of the game, leaving the offense more one-dimensional than they would otherwise like. The 4-2 Lions will look to shake off their loss in Week 7 with a home matchup against the Buccaneers on Monday Night Football, before getting a mid-season breather with a Week 8 bye.</description>

      <title>Jameson Williams caught 6-of-7 targets for 66 yards and a touchdown in the Lions’ Week 6 loss to the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-db9e-dd4c-afb9-ffdf10790000</link>
      <description>Williams scored on a 22-yard dart from quarterback Jared Goff early in the second quarter, catching the ball over the middle of the field before getting popped by three defenders while adding six yards after the catch entering the end zone. It was an otherwise quiet night for the offense as they were unable to work the deep areas of the field against the 4-3, Cover-2-heavy Kansas City defense. Those alignments forced Goff and company to pepper the short and intermediate areas, capping their ability to generate any meaningful splash plays. It worked perfectly as the Detroit offense began to sputter while being forced to march the field. Even so, Williams proved he is much more than a simple field stretcher in this offense, something he will look to double up on next week when the Lions host the Buccaneers.</description>

      <title>Sam LaPorta caught 5-of-6 targets for 55 yards and a touchdown in the Lions’ Week 6 loss to the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dba1-d94a-a79d-dbadb04e0000</link>
      <description>LaPorta started off hot catching multiple passes on the team’s first possession, but was then largely invisible until an outrageous fourth quarter touchdown where he was able to secure the ball with one hand before getting both feet inbounds in the back of the end zone, with a defender draped over one arm. LaPorta now has touchdowns in consecutive games after scoring 17 total touchdowns in his first two seasons in the league.</description>

      <title>Amon-Ra St. Brown caught 9-of-10 targets for 45 yards in the Lions’ Week 6 loss to the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dba4-def2-abdb-dfe562b60000</link>
      <description>St. Brown saw a pedestrian first half before the Lions were forced to attack the short-to-intermediate areas of the field against a 4-3, Cover-2-heavy Steve Spagnuolo defense that all but eliminating downfield passing. The 10 targets handily led the team but the modest yardage total ranked behind both Jameson Williams and Sam LaPorta, the latter two of whom each also found the end zone in the loss. St. Brown remains a WR1 in fantasy circles ahead of a Week 7 showdown with the Buccaneers on Monday Night Football.</description>

      <title>Patrick Mahomes completed 22-of-30 passes for 257 yards and three touchdowns in the Chiefs’ 30-17, Week 6 win over the Lions, adding 32 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dba8-d94a-a79d-dbadc9b90000</link>
      <description>Mahomes played an inspired game, marching the field and converting when he had to and delivering the grit in other situations. His second quarter rushing score from one yard out falls in the latter bucket, which allowed the Chiefs to double the Lions up around the break after tacking on another score on their first possession of the second half. It was that 14-point spurt that put the Chiefs up for good. Mahomes has continued to have to overcome a largely nonexistent run game as he still leads the team in rushing through six weeks, but the team gets standout wide receiver Rashee Rice back after his six-game suspension culminated with the win, giving Mahomes his top option through the air back ahead of a Week 7 divisional tilt against the Raiders.</description>

      <title>Isiah Pacheco rushed 12 times for 51 yards in the Chiefs’ Week 6 win over the Lions, catching one target for zero yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dbad-d94a-a79d-dbadb1630000</link>
      <description>Pacheco’s earth-shaking running style was on full display in this one as positive game script allowed the Chiefs to give the veteran back second half carries as they began to ice the game. Pacheco was kept out of the end zone for the sixth consecutive game, this time watching as Mahomes scored from one yard out just before the half. With volume unlikely and a shrinking red zone role, Pacheco is nothing more than trade fodder in fantasy circles as we approach the halfway point in the season.</description>

      <title>Kareem Hunt rushed six times for 23 yards in the Chiefs’ Week 6 win over the Lions, adding 11 yards on one reception.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dbb0-d94a-a79d-dbbde70b0000</link>
      <description>The team turned to Isiah Pacheco over Hunt as they looked to ice the game in the fourth quarter, but it was quarterback Patrick Mahomes that scored on the ground from one yard out just before the half for the team’s only rushing score of the game. Hunt can’t be treated as anything more than a touchdown-dependent FLEX unless there is an injury ahead of him this season.</description>

      <title>Travis Kelce caught 6-of-7 passes for 78 yards in the Chiefs’ Week 6 win over the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-dbb3-def2-abdb-dff375df0000</link>
      <description>Kelce caught Patrick Mahomes’ first pass attempt for a 15-yard gain on the team’s first possession to set the tone for the evening, shaking free up the middle on multiple occasions to return his best yards per reception and total yardage outing of the season. It will be interesting to see how the tam incorporates Rashee Rice back into the offense as the second-year wide receiver is due back from a six-game suspension in Week 7 against the Buccaneers. It could leave Kelce with a muted role until later in the season when games begin to bear more weight.</description>
