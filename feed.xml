      <title>ESPN’s Ryan McFadden reports Raiders TE Michael Mayer could see an increased role after the team traded Jakobi Meyers to the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4fe7-d45b-affe-5ff73bf40000</link>
      <description>Mayer saw seven targets last week against the Jaguars, second on the team behind Brock Bowers (13). Mayer logged a pass route on 70 percent of the Raiders’ drop backs as the team used two tight end sets at one of the highest rates of Week 9. Meyers’ absence from the Vegas offense should make Mayer somewhat interesting in deeper fantasy leagues, especially if the Raiders are continually forced into pass-heavy game scripts.</description>

      <title>Colts acquired CB Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets for AD Mitchell and two first-round picks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-4ffe-d1e7-a1fa-5ffe4db40000</link>
      <description>Chris Ballard has paid the first-round pick freight for a defender before, when he added DeForest Buckner to the Colts ahead of the 2020 season. It’s a stunning repudiation of the Jets’ plan to have Gardner in their core, but then again they probably never pictured they would be able to get two first-round picks for him before signing him to a long-term extension. Indianapolis’ cornerback room has been in dire need of an upgrade like this on paper for a long time. The problem is that it’s mostly on paper at this point, as Gardner has posted back-to-back PFF coverage grades of 68.1 in 2025 and 73.1 in 2024, a far cry from his 2022 and 2023 seasons. He has not taken to Aaron Glenn’s aggressive system quite as well as expected, and perhaps not as well as the Jets expected either. So the Jets will take the rebuilding road here. For the Colts, even if Gardner isn’t who he was in his first two seasons, he’s a massive upgrade as they attempt to hold on to the AFC South and prime playoff seeding. Their starting cornerbacks last week were Jaylon Jones and Mekhi Blackmon, and once Charvarius Ward is healthy they could throw out Ward, Gardner, and Kenny Moore come playoff time.</description>

      <title>Jets acquired WR AD Mitchell from the Colts, along with two first-round picks, for CB Sauce Gardner.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5007-d713-ad9e-7c571b720000</link>
      <description>Mitchell was buried on the Colts depth chart after he fumbled a touchdown away before the goalline, costing Indianapolis a win against the Rams. He played only 24 offensive snaps in four games afterwards. This could not be any better of a situation for him to rebound ... except for the fact that the Jets have no real quarterback. Mitchell should quickly become the Jets No. 2 wideout opposite of Garrett Wilson. He’s not worth a huge pre-emptive strike in FAAB or anything given the Jets’ circumstances, but Mitchell does have big time talent and it is exciting to see him in an opportunity where he has a chance to realize it.</description>

      <title>Seahawks acquired WR Rashid Shaheed from the Saints in exchange for fourth and fifth-round picks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5001-d673-a39e-f49197740000</link>
      <description>The trade reunites Shaheed with Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak, who held the same role in New Orleans last year. Shaheed has continued his success as the Saints’ deep ball specialist in 2025, racking up 499 yards and two scores through nine games. A drastic improvement in quarterback play should do wonders for his already strong efficiency, even if there is less volume to go around in Seattle. His presence will likely knock Tory Horton out of the starting rotation once Cooper Kupp is healthy. Horton, who has five receiving scores this year, is only worth holding in deeper fantasy leagues. Shaheed will be an extremely boom/bust WR3 once he gets up to speed in Seattle.</description>

      <title>Bears acquired EDGE Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and a seventh-round pick from the Browns for a sixth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-501a-d713-ad9e-7c5e773b0000</link>
      <description>Tryon-Shoyinka has played just 31 defensive snaps for the Browns this year after being signed as a rotational EDGE player. He’ll try to fill in the hole left by Dayo Odeyingbo’s torn Achilles for the Bears.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) is “dealing with a low-grade high ankle sprain” but has a chance to play this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5025-d45b-affe-55b7e70e0000</link>
      <description>You won’t believe how low this high-ankle sprain is, folks. It’s practically in the ground itself. Any time a high-ankle sprain comes to light we mentally budget for the worst and even if the Jaguars don’t want to admit it, it probably helped drive the acquisition of Jakobi Meyers in the short term. We’ll monitor Thomas’ practice reports this week but it sounds like he’s on the pessimistic side of questionable heading into the week.</description>

      <title>Steelers signed WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5030-d673-a39e-f4b14b950000</link>
      <description>This is team three for MVS this year after spending time in Seattle and San Francisco. He doesn’t appear to be a threat to playing time right away — it is a practice squad contract — but it’s not like the Steelers have much beyond DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin in the receiver room that has proven to be better than MVS. We wouldn’t be surprised if he eventually became a low-volume part of the offense. You don’t need to spend FAAB on him unless you’re in a 20-team league.</description>

      <title>Cowboys acquired DT Quinnen Williams from the Jets for DT Mazi Smith, a 2026 second-round pick and a 2027 first-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5042-d713-ad9e-7c56b5d50000</link>
      <description>Williams is notably not Micah Parsons, but if for some reason you can’t have Parsons, he’s probably on the short list of defensive line stars in the league. He’s a star run defender — something we seem to recall the Cowboys needing — by virtue of splash plays. Williams has only one sack this year, but the Jets have not held many leads and Williams does have 23.5 sacks in his past seasons. The Jets star defender has 1.5 years remaining on a four-year, $96 million extension signed in 2023. So the Cowboys will make sure to have someone with an expiring contract distraction on the roster in 2026, as nature abhors a vacuum. The Jets are now a conceptual football team, the closest thing we’ve seen to one since the Sashi Brown Browns anyway. So from that standpoint, Mazi Smith, a theoretical defensive tackle, is a great addition.</description>

      <title>49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open the 21-day practice window for Brandon Aiyuk (knee/PUP) this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5069-d45b-affe-55ff75180000</link>
      <description>We’re not surprised to see that Shanahan’s Week 10 estimate given in October was too optimistic — the 49ers have been very cavalier about feeding the optimism this year on Aiyuk. Assuming that the 49ers want him to actually have a real runway of practice before he acclimates, it is feeling more and more likely that Aiyuk is only back on the field for the final month or so of the regular season.</description>

      <title>49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said the timeline for Ricky Pearsall (knee) “remains fuzzy.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-506e-d673-a39e-f4ffee6c0000</link>
      <description>Shanahan added that Pearsall will be “evaluated midweek to see whether he can return to practice,” which is a more optimistic point of view. Pearsall-reliant managers have gotten used to this over the last month or so, but it looks like he’s definitely questionable-at-best for a return in Week 10.</description>
