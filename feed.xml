      <title>Dolphins signed K Riley Patterson to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee2c-de13-afdc-eeef3fa00000</link>
      <description>He’s expected to be elevated and kick for the Dolphins in Week 1 against the Colts. As long as Patterson doesn’t leave points off the field, he should have a chance to replace Jason Sanders throughout his entire IR stint. Sanders is expected back in 4-5 weeks.</description>

      <title>Raiders claimed OLB Brennan Jackson off waivers from the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee2f-db7b-a5dd-ee2f274a0000</link>
      <description>The 2024 fifth-rounder flashed as a pass rusher this preseason and the Raiders need all the help at EDGE they can get. Jackson should be a part of the rotation after playing just 47 defensive snaps for the Rams in 2024.</description>

      <title>Raiders placed Aidan O’Connell (wrist) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee32-d332-a1fd-fe36906f0000</link>
      <description>He was expected to miss 6-8 weeks after getting hurt in the preseason finale, so while he can theoretically be back for Week 5, O’Connell’s timeline is probably a little deeper than that. After the Raiders acquired Kenny Pickett, there’s little reason to believe O’Connell will throw a pass for the team this year.</description>

      <title>Jayden Reed (foot) returned to practice but said Week 1 “still feels uncertain.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee36-dbe3-a9bb-fe77e1010000</link>
      <description>Reed apparently isn’t yet running routes without pain. We’ll be monitoring Reed’s practice status ahead of Week 1’s game against the Lions, but with both Reed himself and Matt LaFleur setting early expectations that Reed will miss the game, fantasy managers should be prepared to pivot away from Reed.</description>

      <title>Cardinals signed RB Michael Carter to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee3d-dbe3-a9bb-fe7f4fe10000</link>
      <description>Carter surprisingly lost out to Zonovan Knight for the final roster spot at running back, but decided to remain with the Cardinals practice squad. Joining him so far are: WR Andre Baccellia, LB Elliott Brown, OL Jeremiah Byers, OL Jake Curhan, TE Josiah Deguara, WR Simi Fehoko, DL Anthony Goodlow, CB Darren Hall, OL Sincere Haynesworth, OL Nick Leverett, WR Tejhaun Palmer and DL Elijah Simmons.</description>

      <title>Titans signed WR Xavier Restrepo to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee44-de13-afdc-eecff7ce0000</link>
      <description>The former Miami (FL) receiver stays with his quarterback, albeit a beat away from actual NFL playing time on the practice squad. The Titans also added WR Mason Kinsey, WR James Proche II, QB Trevor Siemian, OL Andrew Rupcich, DT Isaiah Raikes, DE Ali Gaye, RB Jordan Mims, DB Kendell Brooks, DT Cam Horsley, RB Jermar Jefferson, DB Amani Oruwariye, DE Carlos Watkins, TE Thomas Odukoya and C Corey Levin to their practice squad.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee44-de13-afdc-eecff7ce0000</guid>

      <title>Raiders signed QB Cam Miller to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee53-dbe3-a9bb-fe53f8b20000</link>
      <description>Miller finished with a 38.8 PFF offense grade for his 80 preseason snaps at quarterback. It would be surprising if the Raiders turned to him at any point this season, but perhaps he can take a step forward and show more next preseason. Also joining the Las Vegas practice squad are: WR Alex Bachman, RB Chris Collier, S Terrell Edmunds, DE Jahfari Harvey, WR Shedrick Jackson, LB Matt Jones, DT Treven Ma’ae, G Atonio Mafi, TE Albert Okwuegbunam Jr., TE Carter Runyon, WR Justin Shorter, OL Laki Tasi, S Trey Taylor, CB Greedy Vance, T Dalton Wagner and S JT Woods.</description>

      <title>Packers signed WR Mecole Hardman to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee58-dbe3-a9bb-fe5be04e0000</link>
      <description>Hardman was waived at last cuts but decided that staying with the Packers made sense. The 27-year-old will likely be elevated in Week 1 if Jayden Reed’s injury is as serious as it seems. Also joining the Packers practice squad are: QB Clayton Tune, RB Israel Abanikanda, DL Deslin Alexandre, DB Johnathan Baldwin, T Brant Banks, DL James Ester, LB Jamon Johnson, K Mark McNamee, DL Arron Mosby, WR Isaiah Neyor, WR Will Sheppard, DB Jaylin Simpson, and LB Kristian Welch.</description>

      <title>Dolphins signed RB Jeff Wilson to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee5f-dbe3-a9bb-fe5fbc2f0000</link>
      <description>With Brian Robinson now in San Francisco, Wilson probably felt better about his chances of being elevated off Miami’s practice squad. The Dolphins also signed TE Greg Dulcich, CB BJ Adams, CB Cornell Armstrong, LB Quinton Bell, OL Braeden Daniels, WR AJ Henning, DT Alex Huntley, LB Derrick McLendon, K Riley Patterson, OL Josh Priebe, TE Hayden Rucci, S John Saunders Jr., TE Theo Wease Jr., S Jordan Colbert to their practice squad.</description>

      <title>Cowboys signed QB Will Grier to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ee69-d332-a1fd-fe7f7a580000</link>
      <description>The usual. Grier spent all of 2022 and most of 2024 with the Cowboys practice squad. He’s back to ride again. Joining him on the Dallas practice squad are: LB Justin Barron, WR Jalen Brooks, DT Earnest Brown, G Saahdiq Charles, T Geron Christian, S Alijah Clark, WR Jalen Cropper, RB Malik Davis, TE Rivaldo Fairweather, TE Princeton Fant, CB Kemon Hall, WR Traeshon Holden, LB Buddy Johnson and CB Robert Rochell.</description>
