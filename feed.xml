      <title>Commanders WR Terry McLaurin (quad) has been ruled out for Week 6 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d413-def2-abdb-dd7304500000</link>
      <description>McLaurin was trending in the wrong direction with multiple missed practices this week. Now he’s officially been ruled out for Week 6’s matchup with the Bears, which will mark McLaurin’s third consecutive missed game. Deebo Samuel should dominate targets again for the Commanders with Luke McCaffrey seeing an increased role downfield.</description>

      <title>Commanders WR Deebo Samuel (heel) is questionable for Week 6 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d446-def2-abdb-dd67ff430000</link>
      <description>Fellow wide receiver Terry McLaurin and Noah Brown have already been ruled out, while Samuel saw his practice reps managed this week and ultimately drew the questionable tag. Per the team, he appears to be legitimately questionable and some familiar with the situation have labeled him a game-time decision. That is not what fantasy managers want to hear considering the Commanders play on Monday night this week. It might be time to make alternate plans.</description>

      <title>Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel said QB Tua Tagovailoa’s hip injury is the same side as the one he injured when at Alabama.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d44c-def2-abdb-dd6d4d7b0000</link>
      <description>He also said that the injury is “otherwise unrelated” to the injury the quarterback suffered in 2019. Tagovailoa is expected to start in Week 6 after getting in full practices throughout the week, taking on a Chargers defense that could make life difficult on the depleted offense. The weekly fantasy upside clearly takes a hit without Tyreek Hill on the field, leaving Tua a low-upside QB2 the rest of the season.</description>

      <title>Falcons ruled out WR Darnell Mooney (hamstring) for Week 6 against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d459-def2-abdb-dd791c5d0000</link>
      <description>Mooney was injured in the team’s Week 4 game against the Commanders and did not do enough in practice this week to suit up against the Bills, even following the team’s Week 5 bye. Casey Washington handled 95% of the team’s offensive snaps in Week 1, the last time Mooney was absent, and should step into a featured role alongside Drake London.</description>

      <title>Lions downgraded T Taylor Decker (shoulder) to out for Week 6 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d473-def2-abdb-dd7310a40000</link>
      <description>The Lions will be without one of their premier offensive linemen against an aggressive Kansas City pass rush that currently ranks sixth in blitz rate at over 32%. That could lead to a more ball-out-quick offensive structure, likely benefiting both Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs through the air. The team also downgraded DB Avonte Maddox (hamstring) and OL Giovanni Manu (knee) to out.</description>

      <title>Falcons removed CB A.J. Terrell (hamstring) from the injury report Saturday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d479-def2-abdb-dd79c7d90000</link>
      <description>That puts Terrell in line to return from a two-game absence against one of the top teams in the AFC on Monday night. The Bills don’t necessarily have a top wide receiver for Terrell to shadow, although he is likely to see the most of second-year standout Keon Coleman on the perimeter.</description>

      <title>Bears listed TE Colston Loveland (hip) questionable for Monday Night Football against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d47c-db72-a199-fe7f3aaa0000</link>
      <description>Loveland has yet to live up to his offseason hype but is a rookie coming out of his bye, keeping him worthy of a potential deep league stash on the end of fantasy benches. He’ll first need to get on the field, heading into the weekend listed as questionable for the team’s Monday Night Football contest against the Commanders.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d47c-db72-a199-fe7f3aaa0000</guid>

      <title>Bills listed TE Dalton Kincaid (oblique) as questionable for Week 6 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d49e-db72-a199-fedf18510000</link>
      <description>Kincaid managed limited showings in all practices this week but did not do enough to avoid an injury designation for Week 6. We tentatively expect him to play against the Falcons, although fantasy managers could be forced to make alternate plans considering the team plays in the second-to-last game of the weekend on Monday night.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d49e-db72-a199-fedf18510000</guid>

      <title>Panthers WR Jalen Coker (quad) is out for Week 6 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d4e2-dd4c-afb9-f7e306460000</link>
      <description>Coker practiced this week as he attempts to make his season debut following a preseason quadricep injury, marking another week where veteran Hunter Renfrow will handle primary slot duties. It’s a slight hit to the upside of the passing game considering the heavy rates of zone coverage from the Dallas defense, particularly due to the struggles of Bryce Young against zone this season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Saints RB Alvin Kamara (ankle) is expected to play in Week 6 against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-d4ee-def2-abdb-ddef94660000</link>
      <description>Kamara remains listed as questionable after three consecutive limited sessions this week. It is unclear when he experienced the ankle injury, although he was seen participating as normal to begin Wednesday’s session before he was unable to finish with the team. Kamara might cede more usage to Kendre Miller if not fully healthy.</description>
