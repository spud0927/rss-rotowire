      <title>Vikings designated RB Aaron Jones (hamstring) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-080f-d99b-a1df-3a0fc6360000</link>
      <description>His 21-day window is now open, meaning he can be inactive for only three more games before returning to the roster or being ruled out for the season. Per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Jones could “potentially” return for Week 8’s game against the Chargers on Thursday night. Jones doesn’t necessarily need practice reps to play, but we’re still curious about the practice report listings for him today and tomorrow. If Jones does return, he’ll cut Jordan Mason down to a FLEX play and perhaps be a usable-but-risky FLEX play himself against a weak Chargers run defense.</description>

      <title>Chargers signed RB Trayveon Williams to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-081d-da18-a39a-da1f9c0e0000</link>
      <description>It sounds like a hedge against Hassan Haskins missing Week 8. Nyheim Hines is the on-roster backup to Kimani Vidal, though Hines is more of a pass-catching back. It’s possible Williams is active against the Vikings, though we couldn’t confidently predict a real role for him at this point.</description>

      <title>Falcons released WR Ray-Ray McCloud.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-085d-d651-a9df-695d97390000</link>
      <description>McCloud was sent home by the Falcons last week over “a private matter,” and it seems like the distance did not make whatever the team and McCloud don’t see eye-to-eye about any better. The 29-year-old wideout is talented enough to catch on in another receiver room if the issue isn’t a big deal to other teams.</description>

      <title>Chargers placed DL Otito Ogbonnia (elbow) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0860-d99b-a1df-3a6c89170000</link>
      <description>He’ll miss at least the next four weeks with an injury suffered against the Colts in Week 4. The 2022 fifth-rounder has largely been a below-average run defender per PFF, and had played just 66 snaps this year.</description>

      <title>Raiders WR Jakobi Meyers said he “for sure” still desires to be traded.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0873-d99b-a1df-3a7ff5b00000</link>
      <description>Asked about the trade deadline, Meyers said “I got no control over that. If I’m here, I’m here.” He also noted that he is open to an extension with the Raiders, but that “that window kind of just closed with the offseason ... If it gets done, I don’t care for real. I really just want to be in a good spot for me [and] my family.” It certainly makes plenty of sense for the Raiders to move on from Meyers given how far away they look right now, and it could enable them to give a longer trial to second-rounder Jack Bech inside. But it sounds like Meyers just wants an extension either way, perhaps limiting his market.</description>

      <title>Commanders coach Dan Quinn told Ben Standig that “the plan” is for Terry McLaurin (quad) to have a full week of practice ahead of Week 8.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0894-d99b-a1df-3a9c48bd0000</link>
      <description>Of course, the plan has shifted a few times on the Commanders with McLaurin’s return, and Quinn hasn’t exactly offered a full endorsement that he’ll be back, so take this for what it is. It’s an encouraging sign that the coach thinks McLaurin can practice in full this week, but we’ll be monitoring his status on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday closely.</description>

      <title>Commanders coach Dan Quinn told Ben Standig that “the plan” is for Deebo Samuel (heel) to have a full week of practice ahead of Week 8.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-089e-d99b-a1df-3a9ed4740000</link>
      <description>Deebo seemed the closer call of the two for Week 7, and the Commanders do have an extra day of rest this week, so we’re a little more optimistic that he’ll be ready to roll against the Chiefs. This injury remains firmly in the “check every practice” phase. Samuel could be a fantasy WR2 if he clears this week, particularly if Terry McLaurin (quad) remains sidelined.</description>

      <title>Cowboys activated WR Jonathan Mingo (knee) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-08a8-d99b-a1df-3aac7cbd0000</link>
      <description>He’ll return to a reserve role, perhaps challenging Jalen Tolbert for some snaps. Ultimately, nobody lower in the Dallas pecking order at receiver is worth rostering for fantasy purposes with how interchangeably they’re being used.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-08a8-d99b-a1df-3aac7cbd0000</guid>

      <title>Saints signed RB Audric Estime to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-08c7-d651-a9df-69d726190000</link>
      <description>With Kendre Miller down for the year with a torn ACL, Estime looks like the replacement back between the tackles. Devin Neal is set up to have the first run behind Alvin Kamara, but it’s possible that Taysom Hill gets so many of the carries and gadget plays that Neal has no real ceiling. No need to rush out and claim Estime, but if he impresses the Saints in their building, perhaps he’ll get a shot later in the season. New Orleans re-signed Velus Jones to their 53-man roster as a direct replacement for Miller, but Jones is just a kick returner at this point.</description>

      <title>Chargers RB Hassan Haskins (hamstring) is “doubtful” for Week 8, according to head coach Jim Harbaugh.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-08cc-da18-a39a-dadfe2190000</link>
      <description>Haskins was an estimated DNP in Monday’s practice and now Jim Harbaugh is calling the 25-year-old doubtful for the Chargers’ Week 8 game against the Vikings. He likely suffered the strain on Sunday and without practicing the first two days of a short week, Haskins is unlikely to go on Thursday night. Nyheim Hines looks to be Kimani Vidal’s backup, though Vidal is the only fantasy-relevant player in the Los Angeles backfield.</description>
