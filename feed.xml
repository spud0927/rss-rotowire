      <title>Jaguars WR/CB Travis Hunter (upper body) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-cdb6-dbe3-a9bb-fdf73e120000</link>
      <description>The Jaguars eased Hunter into action via limited participation on Tuesday and Wednesday, with the goal of having him practice against the Dolphins in today’s joint practice. Jaguars head coach Liam Coen “considered” allowing Hunter to participate today, but “wanted to avoid any chance that Hunter could aggravate the injury.” Plans change, and no setbacks have been reported. Coen adds that if Thursday’s practice were a game, Hunter “probably” would have played. None of the starters will play in the Jaguars’ preseason Week 3 game against the Dolphins. Fantasy managers are advised to continue drafting Hunter as a WR3 with upside.</description>

      <title>Rams head coach Sean McVay said Matthew Stafford (back) is practicing in full this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-cde7-db7b-a5dd-ede7373a0000</link>
      <description>McVay feels “good” about Stafford’s current participation level. Hopefully, Stafford can remain setback-free as he shakes off rust and develops rapport with his pass catchers. He makes for a shaky QB2 in fantasy. Unsurprisingly, Stafford will not participate in the Rams’ preseason Week 3 game against the Browns.</description>

      <title>Tee Higgins resumed practicing after briefly having his left ankle examined by Bengals trainers on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-cdde-dbe3-a9bb-fddf5a9d0000</link>
      <description>Higgins appears to be just fine. Typically, brief visits with trainers end up being afterthoughts and there is no reason to think this situation will end differently. Higgins has a lengthy lower-body injury history, particularly with regard to his hamstrings, so we’re noting this for posterity’s sake. Higgins’ third-round ADP in PPR formats is reasonable, though his WR12 ranking is perhaps a tad high. Still, he remains a reliable producer when on the field.</description>

      <title>Commanders head coach Dan Quinn indicated Chris Rodriguez Jr. is “likely” to handle short-yardage and goal-line rushing duties.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-cdf7-dbe3-a9bb-fdf7dce20000</link>
      <description>Beat reporter Ben Standig thankfully posed the question with fantasy managers in mind. Quinn complimented Rodriguez’s short-area tackle-breaking ability because it suits the Commanders’ “untraditional” tactic of not using a lead blocker in short-yardage situations. Jacory Croskey-Merritt is still in the hunt for lead back duties but if Rodriguez is set to assume short-yardage duties while Austin Ekeler plays on passing downs, the starter could be left with empty calorie touches between the 20s. Croskey-Merritt is a talented, young player but keep in mind, a wide range of outcomes is in play. Rodriguez makes for a worthwhile bench stash given Quinn’s comments.</description>

      <title>Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh declined to address whether Najee Harris (eye) could begin the regular season on the reserve/non-football injury list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ce16-de13-afdc-cedf06f40000</link>
      <description>When asked about Harris’ potential placement on the reserve/NFI list, Harbaugh danced his way around the answer by saying, “when Najee is ready to play, Najee will be ready to play.” He then told reporters that speculation regarding Harris’ status beyond “today” goes “over the legal limit of what-ifs.” This is not reassuring. If Harris begins the year on the reserve/NFI list, he will be required to sit out at least four games. Omarion Hampton is an RB2 with RB1 upside. Fantasy managers can treat rookie RB Raheim Sanders as a late-round bench stash.</description>

      <title>Chargers WR Tre’ Harris is expected to miss Thursday’s practice after leaving Wednesday’s practice early due to “tightness.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ce25-dbe3-a9bb-fe77d0fc0000</link>
      <description>Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh is being his typical, tight-lipped self on this one. Missing time is unideal for Harris, who has failed to secure the team’s X-receiver role. Harris will be afforded plenty more opportunities to secure a starting role, given his second-round draft capital. He should only be considered a dart throw in re-draft at this time.</description>

      <title>Quentin Johnston (neck) returned to practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ce3c-de13-afdc-ceffb6740000</link>
      <description>Johnston suffered the injury five days ago. His return coincides with Tre’ Harris’ (tightness) sidelining. Although Johnston has disappointed through two NFL seasons, he has yet another chance to secure a starting role in three-wide receiver sets. He will have a tough time reliably returning flex value, though.</description>

      <title>Bills CB Tre’Davious White left practice early on Thursday after suffering an apparent leg injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-cdef-db7b-a5dd-edeffeb30000</link>
      <description>White reportedly hopped on one leg, over to Bills’ trainers, before being carted to the locker room. No word on the injury’s specifics yet. Fellow CB Christian Benford exited practice early as well, though he later said he is okay and “just needed some rest.”</description>

      <title>Saints announced QB Spencer Rattler will start in preseason Week 3 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ce44-d332-a1fd-de76e5710000</link>
      <description>Saints quarterbacks have looked great, playing against backups through two preseason games. Last week, Rattler was the one who starred in the second half. Entering the third preseason game as the starter could suggest that Rattler has slightly pulled ahead of rookie QB Tyler Shough, though the Saints would likely prefer to have their new second-round pick win the role. Regardless, neither player is re-draft-relevant.</description>

      <title>Packers head coach Matt LaFleur addressed trade rumors regarding Romeo Doubs by saying, “that will not happen.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-ce7f-db7b-a5dd-ee7fd9460000</link>
      <description>LaFleur then explained why the organization is not open to trading Doubs, saying, “Rome is out there competing” and has done “everything that we need to see from him.” The team suspended Doubs for one game last year, after the veteran receiver complained about his target rate. It sounds like the two sides are in a good spot. Doubs is set to continue operating as a Packers starter and profiles as a matchup-based flex option.</description>
