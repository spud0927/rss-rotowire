      <title>Rams WR Davante Adams (hamstring) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-eba9-dce4-a1da-fbbf99590000</link>
      <description>The unstoppable touchdown scorer is on track to play in Week 14 against the Cardinals this weekend. Adams has played through injuries already this season. Even if he were to be limited as an open-field player, the Rams will feature him in scoring position. He is a WR1 if active, as expected.</description>

      <title>Rams RB Kyren Williams (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>

      <description>Williams told reporters, post-game, that “his ankle is good because he had scar tissue from a previous injury that helped him when he was rolled up on.” Talk about looking on the bright side. Regardless, Williams is on track to face the Cardinals this weekend with No. 2 RB Blake Corum frequently rotating in. Williams is a borderline RB1/2.</description>

      <title>Cardinals WR Greg Dortch (chest) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ebab-dce4-a1da-fbbfa3ea0000</link>
      <description>Dortch is seemingly heading toward an absence for the Cardinals’ Week 14 game against the Rams. The veteran wide receiver was working his way into FLEX territory just a few weeks ago. He does not need to be rostered at this time. Cardinals WR Xavier Weaver (hamstring) was added to the injury report on Thursday.</description>

      <title>Chargers RB Omarion Hampton (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ebb5-d005-a9bf-fbb5b6690000</link>
      <description>Hampton’s limited participation is encouraging. The Chargers’ starting running back had his 21-day practice window opened on November 25th, though, so the team still has a way to go before they have to make an official decision on his status. Hampton has a chance to play this week. Hopefully, we will have word by the end of the day on Saturday regarding his Week 14 availability.</description>

      <title>Chargers WR Quentin Johnston (shoulder) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ebb5-da9b-a9bf-ffbdbd4a0000</link>
      <description>Johnston is on track to play this week, despite being listed with a new injury. The streaky perimeter wide receiver remains a weekly FLEX candidate, and his team’s Week 14 game against the Eagles should be a fantasy-friendly environment. Hopefully, he practices fully tomorrow.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports that Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) gave him “the thumbs up that he is indeed playing” in Week 14 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ebbc-d005-a9bf-fbbcf13a0000</link>
      <description>The Lions will announce the official inactive list shortly, but for now, it appears as though they will have their star slot receiver on the field for their Thursday Night Football game against the Cowboys. St. Brown should be in fantasy lineups if active.</description>

      <title>Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) is active for Week 14 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ebc2-dce4-a1da-fbd6d04f0000</link>
      <description>St. Brown was unable to practice this week after injuring his ankle last Thursday against the Packers. While he possesses some re-injury risk, he was moving very well during warmups and should be started against the Cowboys this evening. The Lions declared S Kerby Joseph, WR Kalif Raymond, OG Kayode Awosika, TE Hayden Rucci, DL Mekhi Wingo and DL Tyler Lacy inactive for Week 14 against the Cowboys. Lions RT Penei Sewell (shoulder), LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/rest) and C Graham Glasgow (knee) are active.</description>

      <title>Cowboys declared DE Jadeveon Clowney, WR Jalen Tolbert, RB Jaydon Blue, DT Jay Toia, DT Perrion Winfrey and OT Tyler Guyton inactive for Week 14 against the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ebc8-d005-a9bf-fbfc10680000</link>
      <description>Clowney (hamstring) attempted to give it a go in warmups after practicing once, a limited session on Wednesday, this week. He will be missed against the Lions’ top-notch offense. The Cowboys have once again declared Blue, the once-exciting rookie, inactive this week. He does not need to be stashed at this time.</description>

      <title>Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker (glute) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ebce-d77b-adfa-ebcf2d170000</link>
      <description>Walker has been dealing with the glute issue for nearly two weeks. He was not on Wednesday’s initial injury report but the Seahawks ended up adding him to it later in the day. The fact that he continued practicing, albeit in a limited capacity, puts him on track to face the Falcons in Week 14.</description>

      <title>Seahawks TE AJ Barner (knee/shoulder) practiced fully on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ebe1-d005-a9bf-fbf551e60000</link>
      <description>Barner is good to go for the Seahawks’ Week 14 game against the Falcons. Seattle’s low passing volume keeps Barner from the weekly TE1 ranks, but he has proven himself as a capable player and remains a touchdown-scoring candidate each week.</description>
