      <title>Cam Skattebo rushed 19 times for 98 yards and three touchdowns in the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Eagles, adding two receptions for 12 yards.</title>

      <description>Coming off two workhorse performances where he failed to notch a touchdown on 48 combined touches, Skattebo regressed this evening, punching in scores of four, one, and one yards. For the first score, Skattebo busted through some goal-line punishment. For the second, he displayed a crazy second effort. Skattebo is running so hard and tough, but he’s taking a walloping in the process. Beyond the scores, the big story tonight was Skattebo out-touching a returning Tyrone Tracy 21-4. So much for that being a concern. Seemingly locked into 16-20 weekly handles with the upside for more, Skattebo is a high-end RB2 who will produce RB1 weeks. That will be easier said than done for a tough Week 7 road trip to Denver to face the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Jaxson Dart completed 17-of-25 passes for 195 yards and a touchdown in the Giants’ 34-17, Week 6 win over the Eagles, adding 13 carries for 58 yards and a second score.</title>

      <description>Everyone’s favorite new dual-threat reached 10 carries for the second time in three NFL starts, both upset victories over supposedly far superior teams. (Never mind last Sunday’s loss to the Saints.) Whereas the G-Men merely outlasted the Chargers in Week 4, they took it to the Eagles this evening, going up 13-3 10 minutes into the first quarter and out-scoring Philly 14-0 in the second half. Dart’s Newton-ian usage was a big reason why, though it’s downsides were also evident. Dart took a vicious second half pop to his left shoulder that resulted in yet another concussion evaluation. Bizarrely, coach Brian Daboll seemed to be yelling at the medical staff about the matter. Either way, Dart missed only a handful of plays and the Giants went back on their merry way. In addition to the running, this was Dart’s best overall night as a passer despite a limited supporting cast that required an unfathomable eight Lil’Jordan Humphrey targets. No offense to the big man. Dart completed 68 percent of his throws with a 7.8 YPA. If he can approach that efficiency while churning out gains with his legs, Dart is going to be pushing for QB1 status. Week 7 in Denver is a huge road test vs. an elite defense.</description>

      <title>Jalen Hurts completed 24-of-33 passes for 283 yards, one touchdown and an interception in the Eagles’ 34-17, Week 6 loss to the Giants, adding seven carries for 13 yards and a second score.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc2a-d94a-a79d-cd2faa720000</link>
      <description>Hurts’ 283 yards passing were a new season high for the second time in five days, but it would be inaccurate to say he had a great night slinging it. He missed DeVonta Smith on a wide-open, should-have-been 89-yard score, and tossed a ghastly red zone interception as the Eagles were trying to mount a second half comeback. Under pressure, Hurts made the wrong read and failed to see CB Cor’Dale Flott jumping the route. Hurts was lucky it wasn’t a pick-six, though Flott still managed to return it 68 yards. The “passing” score Hurts did convert was more of a Dallas Goedert rushing touchdown. Hurts’ ground score, naturally, came via “tush push.” Looking replacement-level as a passer of late as his rushing production has decreased over the past two weeks, Hurts does not have a bounce-back Week 7 spot in a Minnesota road trip.</description>

      <title>Dallas Goedert caught 9-of-11 targets for 110 yards and a touchdown in the Eagles’ Week 6 loss to the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc2f-db72-a199-fe6ff3f50000</link>
      <description>The catches, targets and yards were all new season highs, though the touchdown was Goedert’s fifth in the past four games. Although it goes in the books as a three-yard receiving score, it was really more of a Goedert rushing touchdown on a broken trick play. With Jalen Hurts struggling to get his chemistry on track with A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, Goedert for whatever reason has been the beneficiary. Who knows if the Eagles actually want that to continue, but then again, it’s one of the only things working. Healthy and in the midst of one of the more productive stretches of his career, Goedert will be an easy TE1 for Week 7 against the Vikings.</description>

      <title>Saquon Barkley rushed 12 carries for 58 yards in the Eagles’ Week 6 loss to the Giants, adding two receptions for nine yards.</title>

      <description>Coming off a 30-yard dud against the Broncos, bettered that on the Eagles’ first two plays from scrimmage, churning up 31 yards on two carries. So needless to say, it was surprising when he was shut down for the rest of the evening by a highly-suspect Giants run defense. It didn’t help that the G-Men were leading 13-3 after 10 minutes. Having now failed to clear 60 yards rushing in four straight games, Barkley is in a certified slump. For Week 7, he will be facing a Vikings defense more vulnerable on the ground than through the air, but that was also true of the Giants. This is just a struggling offense right now.</description>

      <title>A.J. Brown caught 6-of-9 targets for 80 yards in the Eagles’ Week 6 loss to the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc39-dd4c-afb9-eff90dfe0000</link>
      <description>Brown’s six receptions tied a season high, while his 80 yards were his second most. He also notched a 30-yard reception, just his second of the year. All decent enough developments, but these shouldn’t be notable milestones for a superstar wideout. This is a struggling offense right now, and AJB is bearing the brunt of it. Jalen Hurts seems more comfortable throwing to Dallas Goedert and DeVonta Smith. Although it’s tempting to think that could be some kind of reaction to Brown’s moaning about not getting the ball, the reality is that Brown faces the toughest coverage and is the toughest target to hit for a quarterback currently struggling through the air. Things don’t figure to get a whole lot better against Brian Flores’ pass defense in Week 7, but perhaps Philly can burn gambling Flores on some of his riskier calls.</description>

      <title>DeVonta Smith caught 4-of-5 targets for 49 yards in the Eagles’ Week 6 loss to the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc3e-def2-abdb-dd7f01970000</link>
      <description>That’s already a disappointing statline before you learn Jalen Hurts missed Smith for what should have been a walk-in, 89-yard touchdown. It’s just been that kind of year for Philadelphia’s passing game. Smith also appeared to tweak his left leg, but he received minimal medical attention and was never announced with an injury. If he’s sore tomorrow, he will still have nine more days to rest up for Week 7 against the Vikings. A secondary target in an offense struggling for big plays in the passing game, Smith is more of a WR3 than WR2 until further notice.</description>

      <title>Wan’Dale Robinson caught 6-of-7 targets for 84 yards and a touchdown in the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cc40-db72-a199-fe4b6cd00000</link>
      <description>Robinson’s 84 yards were his most since Week 2 and second most of the season. He finally had a big day in Malik Nabers’ absence. His touchdown was a 35-yarder where Jaxson Dart got outside the pocket, improvised, and found Robinson. The wideout then broke a tackle near the goal line to secure the six points. The Giants are trying to limit their passing volume as Dart learns the NFL game — and keeps calling his own number as a rusher — but Robinson will continue to see the most of it. He’s more of a top-40 option than true WR3 ahead of Week 7 against the Broncos, but Robinson can be justified in most fantasy lineups.</description>

      <title>Theo Johnson caught 2-of-4 targets for 27 yards in the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Eagles.</title>

      <description>Coming off a two-score Week 5 and generating some fantasy buzz, Johnson had a quiet night in a huge Giants upset victory. One of his missed connections was a rough third down drop. Despite the recent scoring binge (three TDs between Weeks 4-5), Johnson has still yet to surpass 34 yards receiving. He’s established a bare-minimum floor but hasn’t really hinted at a ceiling ahead of Week 7 against the Broncos.</description>
