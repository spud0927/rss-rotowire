      <title>Dalton Schultz (knee) is practicing in full for Week 17 against the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5281-d56e-afff-f6e9ae730000</link>
      <description>Schultz was limited for Tuesday’s practice. That is standard fare for veterans this late in the year. A full practice today means he is good to go for Week 17. Schultz has finished as a TE1 in six of his past eight games. While his ceiling is relatively limited, he remains a high-floor TE1 bet for fantasy football championship week.</description>

      <title>Broncos LB Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) will not play in Week 17 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-5286-d56e-afff-f6ee4f1c0000</link>
      <description>Greenlaw went down with a non-contact injury in Week 16 against the Jags. He did not return and it isn’t clear when he will be able to return. Greenlaw has 43 combined tackles, one interception, and one sack in eight games this season.</description>

      <title>Derek Stingley (oblique) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-528c-d56e-afff-f6ec00d10000</link>
      <description>Stingley has been playing through the oblique issue for a while. He was listed as questionable for Week 16, but, per usual, was on the field come Sunday. He was held out of yesterday’s practice, though that’s just load management at this point. Kamari Lassiter was also out of practice on Tuesday. Like Stingley, he returned today and should be good to go for Week 17.</description>

      <title>Maxx Crosby (knee) did not practice Wednedsay.</title>

      <description>Crosby has been playing through the knee issue for a while. A DNP for the first practice of the week is nothing new for him. Even with the Raiders fighting for the No. 1 overall pick on Sunday, we fully expect Crosby to suit up. Crosby has 10 sacks, two forced fumbles, and one interception this year.</description>

      <title>Raiders RB Raheem Mostert (knee/ankle) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-529b-d968-a19b-5afb09670000</link>
      <description>Mostert has been mostly a kick returner this season, getting just 22 carries for 104 yards and 12 receptions for 70 yards on offense. He has returned 23 kicks for 673 yards and any potential absence this week would only have special teams impact. Mostert is dealing with knee and ankle issues and is in jeopardy of missing Week 17 against the Giants.</description>

      <title>Rams opened CB Roger McCreary’s 21-day practice window to be activated off injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-52a8-dc7a-af9b-dfbfab360000</link>
      <description>McCreary was acquired by the Rams in October, but has been sidelined on injured reserve due to a hip injury. The Rams designated him to return to practice, opening his 21-day window to be activated. Head coach Sean McVay also added that DB Quentin Lake’s practice window will likely be activated next week. McCreary and Lake will add reinforcements to the Rams secondary heading into the playoffs.</description>

      <title>Seahawks LT Charles Cross (hamstring) did not practice Wednesday</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-52c8-dc7a-af9b-dfffee1d0000</link>
      <description>Cross suffered the injury in the Seahawks’ Week 15 win over the Colts and missed Week 16 against the Rams. He was reported to have a 2-4 week hamstring injury last week, marking this the second week of the reported timeline. Cross is likely to miss Week 17 with a DNP designation on Wednesday. Also listed as DNP Wednesday was S Coby Bryant (knee), who suffered a knee injury in Week 16. Bryant will need to practice the rest of the week to play in Week 17 against the Panthers, but he is in jeopardy of missing time.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Rams may “shut down” WR Davante Adams (hamstring) for the final two games of the regular season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-52d4-d35e-a1bf-57d609d80000</link>
      <description>Adams is dealing with a hamstring injury that he re-aggravated in Week 15 and caused him to miss Week 16. Head coach Sean McVay said Adams is unlikely for Week 17 and now Fowler is reporting the Rams could shut him down for the final two regular-season games. The Rams still have seeding to deal with, but they will be in the playoffs and could look to get their veteran receiver healthy ahead of the Wild Card round. There is no official injury report yet for Adams as the Rams play on Monday but fantasy managers should stay tuned; it is unlikely he will be good to go for the fantasy championship.</description>

      <title>Commanders RB Chris Rodriguez Jr. (illness) is questionable for Week 17 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-55e1-d35e-a1bf-55e3aee60000</link>
      <description>Rodriguez is a late Christmas morning add to the Commanders’ injury report with an illness. Players tend to play through “illness” listings on the report, but it is notable that Rodriguez was added just a few hours before his team’s Week 17 matchup against the Cowboys. If he cannot go, Jacory Croskey-Merritt has RB3 upside against a weaker Cowboys defense.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reports Lions RB David Montgomery (illness) is expected to be active Week 17 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-55e6-d56e-afff-f7eead300000</link>
      <description>The Lions play the afternoon Christmas game and had Montgomery listed as questionable due to an illness. He missed Tuesday’s practice and was limited Wednesday; Garafolo reports he is expected to go Thursday against the Vikings. Montgomery should have more opportunities in the run game this week with a run-heavy game script looking favorable, giving him RB3 upside for Week 17.</description>
