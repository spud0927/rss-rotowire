      <title>Broncos WR Troy Franklin (hamstring) is questionable to play in the AFC Championship Game against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ecf1-d968-a19b-fcf1554d0000</link>
      <description>Franklin logged three straight limited sessions this week. It is tough to say whether he will be active against the Patriots. He departed early last week. Over his last two games, he has earned just one target. Even if he is active, he is unlikely to operate as a featured player.</description>

      <title>Broncos C Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) is questionable to play in the AFC Championship Game against the Patriots.</title>

      <description>Wattenberg practiced fully all week, so he is seemingly on track to face the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. Getting their stud center back on the field would be great news for the Broncos’ offense, particularly fill-in QB Jarrett Stidham.</description>

      <description>This is Weaver’s second interview with the Steelers, and the first in-person.

      <title>Dolphins hired Kyle Smith as their new assistant general manager.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ed19-d56e-afff-eff954050000</link>
      <description>Smith signed on with the Falcons in 2021 as their vice president of player personnel. He was promoted to the assistant general manager role in 2023 and remained in that role until now. He opts for a lateral move to a new organization as the Falcons rework their front office under new president of football, Matt Ryan.</description>

      <description>Tabor held the same role with the division-rival Bills in 2025. Before that, he served as the Panthers’ special teams coordinator from 2022-2023 and was promoted to interim head coach briefly during the latter season.</description>

      <title>Cowboys requested an interview with Vikings DL coach Marcus Dixon for their potential defensive line coach vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ed62-d968-a19b-fdf3da520000</link>
      <description>Cowboys DL coach Aaron Whitecotton is “drawing interest” from the Titans as they search for a defensive coordinator under new head coach Robert Saleh. Rather than waiting to find out if Whitecotton leaves, the Cowboys are proactively starting their own search for his potential replacement. ESPN’s Todd Archer notes that Dixon coached the Broncos’ defensive line from 2022-2023, while new Cowboys DC Christian Parker coached Broncos defensive backs.</description>
