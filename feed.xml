      <title>Seahawks LT Charles Cross (hamstring) was a full participant in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-b9c7-d35e-a1bf-fdc7b3190000</link>
      <description>Cross (hamstring) was a key injury to keep an eye on heading into the playoffs, having not played since Week 15. The good news is he is practicing in full after the Seahawks’ first-round bye and is likely to go for the Divisional Round against the 49ers. Sam Darnold will have a better time in the pocket with Cross protecting his blind side.</description>

      <title>Oregon TE Kenyon Sadiq has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-b9cb-d35e-a1bf-fdcbf1ce0000</link>
      <description>Sadiq is declaring for the draft early and immediately becomes one of the top tight end prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft. The 20-year-old tallied 24 receptions for 308 yards and two touchdowns as a sophomore for an Oregon team that won the Big Ten Championship. He followed that up with a 51/560/8 line as a junior, leading all college tight ends in touchdown catches. Sadiq will get buzz as potentially the first tight end off the board and is a candidate to be selected in the top half of the first round.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports the Cardinals have requested to interview Texans defensive coordinator Matt Burke for their open head coaching role.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-ba2e-d35e-a1bf-ffee76800000</link>
      <description>At the helm of the Texans defense with head coach DeMeco Ryans for the past three seasons, Burke has helped craft a hard-hitting, powerful defensive line and secondary. He took over defensive play-calling from Ryans towards the start of a season that saw the Texans allow the least yards and second-least points of any team in the NFL, while ranking top-seven in both sacks and interceptions. The Cardinals just moved off a defensive head coach and are now looking to interview another one, requesting an interview with Burke fresh off a two-touchdown defensive performance in the Wild Card Round.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports the Giants, Titans, and Falcons “appear to have the inside track” on hiring John Harbaugh for head coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-baa2-d35e-a1bf-ffe2194a0000</link>
      <description>Harbaugh gave his first interview with the Falcons on Monday after reports the Giants and Titans were also in the mix. Though other teams are interested and pretty much all teams have called, Harbaugh is prioritizing the head coaching vacancies for the Giants, Titans, and Falcons. Pelissero reports he is expected to interview with all three teams by the end of the week. The Falcons have the two oldest starting quarterbacks among the three teams, while Cam Ward and Jaxson Dart are both first-round picks entering their sophomore seasons. The former Ravens head coach is narrowing his options as he gets closer to a decision.</description>

      <title>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s David Murphy believes former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel is the “perfect” offensive coordinator candidate for the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bca6-d56e-afff-feeeeb9e0000</link>
      <description>After firing offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo following a mostly disastrous 2025 season, the Eagles should seek “a fresh set of eyes” to reevaluate the Philly offense and how it utilizes its skill position players, Murphy said. McDaniel, who designed and called plays for a Miami offense that ranked among the NFL’s most efficient from 2022 to 2024 — before the team’s 2025 collapse. Eagles players, including DeVonta Smith, said after the team’s Wild Card loss to the 49ers that the offensive scheme had not changed at all in recent years despite the Eagles shuffling through offensive coordinators. That suggests the problem lies with head coach Nick Sirianni. “Howie Roseman and Jeffrey Lurie pride themselves on being ahead of the curve. They’d rather be a year early than a year late,” Murphy said. “Right now, it is getting late early. McDaniel or not, they need a new voice, an inventive mind, and a fresh set of eyes. Anybody else will end up right where Patullo is. And that’s not fair to anybody.”</description>

      <title>Titans interviewed Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bcfb-dc7a-af9b-ffff911f0000</link>
      <description>Though Smith technically remains the Steelers OC, he’ll be elsewhere in 2026 after head coach Mike Tomlin stepped down on Tuesday afternoon. Smith served as Tennessee’s offensive coordinator from 2019 to 2020, creating a dominant run-heavy offense quarterbacked by Ryan Tannehill. If the Titans bring back Smith as the team’s head coach, he would likely install a similarly run-first offense around QB Cam Ward. Probably it wouldn’t be a great development for Ward’s fantasy prospects in 2026 and beyond. Smith’s Steelers offense in 2025 ranked 18th in EPA per play. They had the league’s sixth highest rushing success rate.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Ian O’Connor reports former Ravens head coach John Harbaugh is meeting with Giants ownership Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bd0f-d35e-a1bf-fdcf90a60000</link>
      <description>O’Connor describes the meeting as a “big development” as multiple teams pursue Harbaugh as their next head coach. The Giants have reportedly been “all in” on landing Harbaugh since he was fired by the Ravens last week. Harbaugh, who won 61.4 percent of his games over 18 seasons in Baltimore, has also talked to the Titans and Falcons about their head coaching vacancies. Jaxson Dart’s hopeful rookie season performance could be the deciding factor for Harbaugh as he weighs his options.</description>

      <title>Cardinals requested an interview with Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bd1d-d968-a19b-fdfdc0df0000</link>
      <description>Smith, still technically the Steelers’ offensive coordinator, is apparently a hot name on the head coaching circuit right now. The Titans are slated to talk with Smith — who once coached Tennessee’s offense — about their head coaching vacancy and now the Cardinals are interested after firing Jonathan Gannon after his disastrous run as Arizona’s head coach. Smith would likely oversee a rebuild in Arizona, with the team seemingly intent on moving on from Kyler Murray. A run-heavy play caller, Smith’s Steelers ranked sixth in rushing success rate and seventh in rushing EPA in 2025.</description>

      <title>Dolphins requested an interview with Jaguars defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bd3f-dc7a-af9b-ffbf2ff90000</link>
      <description>Campanile, who spent three seasons as Miami’s linebackers coach under Brian Flores and Mike McDaniel, is fresh off coaching the Jaguars defense to an astounding 2025 season. Jacksonville ranked second in takeaways and allowed the NFL’s third lowest rushing success rate and the 11th lowest drop back success rate. In Miami, Campanile would take over a defense in need of a rebuild and an uncertain quarterback situation.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports NFL teams have “expressed their interest” in talking to Mike Tomlin about their respective head coaching vacancies.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-bd46-dc7a-af9b-ffff89770000</link>
      <description>Tomlin on Tuesday stepped down from the Steelers head coaching job following the team’s Wild Card loss to the Texans. TV networks are reportedly jockeying to hire Tomlin as an NFL analyst for next season while teams with head coaching vacancies are reaching out in case Tomlin, 54, is still interested in coaching. Rapoport said the Steelers still have Tomlin’s “rights,” and that “draft compensation would be necessary” if a team were to sign Tomlin. “That said, teams were told Tomlin does not plan to coach next year,” Rapoport said. We don’t expect Tomlin on an NFL sideline in 2026.</description>
