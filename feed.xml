      <title>Lions signed RB Deon Jackson, formerly of the Jets, to a contract.</title>

      <description>The Lions also signed OG Gunner Britton, OG Keaton Sutherland, TE Gunnar Oakes, and correspondingly placed OT Justin Herron, OL Colby Sorsdal and TE Kenny Yeboah on season-ending injured reserve.</description>

      <title>Rams head coach Sean McVay said WR Konata Mumpfield (ankle) won’t miss any time.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-959a-d05a-adda-bf9a08160000</link>
      <description>Great news. Mumpfield earned McVay’s praise with his “smart and conscientious” play last week. It will be difficult for him to make his way onto the re-draft radar this year but he is a name to know for dynasty leagues. McVay adds that RB Ronnie Rivers (ribs) and TE Anthony Torres (ankle) will both miss “a little bit of time.”</description>

      <title>Colston Loveland caught 1-of-2 targets for eight yards in the Bears’ preseason Week 1 game against the Dolphins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-95a5-d05a-adda-bfa7e2950000</link>
      <description>Loveland blocked for a moment before shucking off his defender and running a delayed route. He turned upfield after securing the pass and absorbed contact in his surgically repaired right shoulder. He promisingly hopped up after the tackle and appeared no worse for wear. He remains a low-end TE1.</description>

      <title>Kyle Monangai rushed six times for 30 yards and returned one kickoff for 22 yards in the Bears’ preseason Week 1 game against the Dolphins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-95a9-d05a-adda-bfab7f440000</link>
      <description>Monangai had the first two drives all to himself and played all but one snap on the third. He rotated in and out through drives four and five. Monangai ran well, forcing two missed tackles on the ground. The No. 3 running back role behind D’Andre Swift and Roschon Johnson (foot) appears to be his.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Stephen Holder said Colts CB Kenny Moore II “seemed to be in pretty intense pain” after suffering an apparent knee injury on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-95b4-d90d-a5bd-b7ff97bc0000</link>
      <description>That’s bad. Moore is the secondary’s lynchpin defender, lining up on the perimeter in base formations and covering the slot in nickel. Losing him for an extended time period would make the Colts’ secondary one to target in fantasy football.</description>

      <title>Alec Pierce was carted away from Colts practice after suffering an apparent leg injury on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8b0e-df63-a199-db2f73760000</link>
      <description>FOX59’s Mike Chappell reports Pierce left practice early for an examination in the locker room. He then returned to the field and “did some agility work,” before limping off and being taken back to the locker room by cart. Pierce’s injury coincides with Adonai Mitchell making “strides” in his development.</description>

      <title>Jets activated Jermaine Johnson (Achilles) from the active/physically unable to perform list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-95d2-d90d-a5bd-b7dbad140000</link>
      <description>Johnson appears to be on track for Week 1, as he recovers from a season-ending Achilles tendon rupture suffered in Week 2 last year. The Jets were encouraged by Johnson’s recovery this offseason and activated his fifth-year option in April.</description>

      <title>Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said S Kyle Hamilton and B Jaire Alexander are “OK” after missing practice with undisclosed injuries.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-95ca-d90d-a5bd-b7db345e0000</link>
      <description>Hamilton has been sidelined for a few days and Alexander missed time in late July after having his knee drained. Hamilton typically soldiers through in-season injuries and Alexander has a long history of knee issues. It’s a situation to watch.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-95ca-d90d-a5bd-b7db345e0000</guid>

      <title>Bills waived LB Baylon Spector (calf) with an injury settlement.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-95e2-d45c-a7fc-97fa41ac0000</link>
      <description>Spector dealt with injuries in both calves this year. It’s a tough break for a player coming off a season in which he tallied multiple career highs. Spector will likely be invited to try out for backup linebacker/special teams roles once he is in good health.</description>

      <title>Shane Steichen said Daniel Jones will play “a few series” as the Colts’ preseason Week 2 starter but Anthony Richardson will get the “bulk of the work” in the first half.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-95c9-d45c-a7fc-97dbe9ae0000</link>
      <description>Steichen emphasized “consistency,” particularly in joint practices this week, as the key factor in determining who wins the starting role. This can be read as a call to Richardson specifically, who possesses immense talent but continues to be plagued by injuries and errors. If he can simply execute the offense as asked in the coming weeks, the job is likely his.</description>
