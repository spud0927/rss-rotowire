      <title>Chargers HC Jim Harbaugh told reporters that Justin Herbert (hand) will not start in Week 18 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6bfa-dc7a-af9b-efffe75d0000</link>
      <description>Herbert took a beating against the Texans in Week 16 and looked to be in significant pain at the end of that contest, and the Chargers don’t have much to play for in the finale before the playoffs. It’ll likely be Trey Lance starting against Denver, and his dual-threat ability makes his an intriguing — but risky — fantasy play for that finale.</description>

      <title>Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said Marvin Harrison (heel) “hurt his other foot” in Week 17’s loss and will play in Week 18 “if he is healthy enough to play.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c18-d56e-afff-eef8a5190000</link>
      <description>It certainly seems like forcing Harrison to play through this heel injury isn’t helping anybody — he’s caught one ball in two games since returning, leaving each of them early — but Gannon refused to rule it out. Either way, Trey McBride and Michael Wilson are the Cardinals you actually want to start in fantasy leagues in Week 18. Harrison would be hard to trust if active.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said he doubts that Pete Carroll will be the Raiders head coach in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c1e-d56e-afff-eefe44530000</link>
      <description>It’s sort of jammed in to the end of a Bluesky video about the Raiders future, but Rapoport brings up the idea of Fernando Mendoza being the future of the franchise should they finish their tank successfully against the Chiefs and says “We’ll see if Pete Carroll is there for it, I doubt it, but we’ll see.” It would be hard to blame the Raiders for pulling the plug after this disastrous season, but Carroll would be their second-straight one-and-done head coach.</description>

      <title>Packers claimed DL Jonathan Ford off waivers from the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c09-d35e-a1bf-6dcbba830000</link>
      <description>The Packers are hurting in depth, so they’ll turn to Ford; a player that spent 2022-2024 with Green Bay before joining Chicago.</description>

      <title>Colts signed QB Seth Henigan to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c2f-dc7a-af9b-efbf8d910000</link>
      <description>Henigan, 22, could be the emergency third quarterback for Week 18 against the Texans. The former Memphis signal-caller went undrafted in 2025 and spent most of the season in the Jaguars’ system.</description>

      <title>Kurtis Rouke (knee) will remain on the non-football injured list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c34-d56e-afff-eefc5cb50000</link>
      <description>Rourke was not activated off the NFI list before the Week 18 game against the Seahawks. The 2025 seventh-round pick will compete for a backup spot in 2026.</description>

      <title>Texans HC DeMeco Ryans said Monday that QB C.J. Stroud and the starters will play in Week 18 against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c68-d56e-afff-eee834f30000</link>
      <description>The report was relayed via Jonathan Alexander of the Houston Chronicle, wherein Ryans states, “we still have an opportunity to win our division. That’s always the goal each and every year - to win the division. We know we need help from the Titans to be able to do that, so we’re going and playing our guys.” The Texans remain in the hunt for the AFC South Division title but need a win over the Colts and for the Titans to beat the Jaguars. As things currently stand, it sounds as if it will be hands on deck as the Texans look to do their part in that equation.</description>

      <title>Falcons WR Drake London (knee) is active for Week 17 against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c82-d968-a19b-7cf355c80000</link>
      <description>London drew the questionable tag on Saturday after a week of limited practices but will play against the Rams, as was expected. He returned from a four-game absence in Week 16 to play 69% of the team’s offensive snaps, setting out expectations for Monday Night Football. Inactive for the Falcons are CB Mike Hughes, RB Nathan Carter, LB Josh Woods, OL Michael Jerrell, WR Casey Washington, WR Malik Heath, and DL Kentavius Street.</description>

      <title>Rams WR Davante Adams (hamstring) is inactive for Week 17 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c84-dc7a-af9b-efbf730d0000</link>
      <description>This was always thought to be the outcome after Adams missed the entire week of practice before drawing the doubtful tag for Monday Night Football. Expect another heavy dose of Puka Nacua after the third-year receiver erupted for a 12-225-2 line against the Seahawks a week ago. Also inactive for the Rams are OT Alaric Jackson, OG Kevin Dotson, CB Josh Wallace, CB Darious Williams, and RB Jarquez Hunter.</description>

      <title>Rams RB Blake Corum (ankle) was taken to the locker room in the second quarter of Week 17 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-6c87-d35e-a1bf-6dc777bf0000</link>
      <description>Corum checked himself out of the game in the second quarter and made his way gingerly to the sideline in obvious pain. He was checked over by the team’s medical staff before being escorted to the locker room with over four minutes remaining to play before the half. Although no official update has been provided by the team, it certainly appears as if his night is over. Corum managed 18 yards on six carries prior to departing.</description>
