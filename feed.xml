      <title>Patrick Mahomes (knee) is practicing in full for Week 14 against the Texans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e663-db57-afda-f67389190000</link>
      <description>It’s never great to see a star quarterback on the injury report, but a full practice means the knee injury should be a non-issue by Sunday. That better be the case for Mahomes as he is set to take on the Texans’ vaunted pass-rush with as many as three of his starting linemen on the sidelines because of injuries. Expect a lot of quick passing and an uptick in scrmalbing for Mahomes this week.</description>

      <title>Ravens signed Mark Andrews to a three-year, $39.3 million contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e666-d90e-a9da-ff6fb94b0000</link>
      <description>The Ravens tend to keep their best players in-house when possible, but it’s still a bit of an odd move from GM Eric DeCosta. Andrews is 30 years old and is currently on pace for the worst year of his career by yards per game (27.7) and yards per route run (1.3). On the other hand, Lamar Jackson has missed time this year and hasn’t played up to his MVP-caliber standards when healthy, so it’s hard to pin Andrews’ statistical delcine solely on himself. John Harbaugh has also found a niche use for Andrews as the team’s tush push specialst. He has nine carries for six first downs and one touchdown, which came on a tush push fake that went for 35 yards. Andrews is now under contract through 2028.</description>

      <title>J.J. McCarthy (concussion) is practicing in full for Week 14 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e66e-d90e-a9da-ff6f38d40000</link>
      <description>McCarthy missed Week 13 with the brain injury. Despite being one of the least efficient quarterbacks in recent memory, McCarthy still proved to be a better option than Max Brosmer once the latter took the field. Brosmer was intercepted four times versus Seattle, including one pick-six. McCarthy isn’t on the fantasy radar, even if a great matchup versus the Commanders. He might, however, be able to keep the light on for Justin Jefferson as a WR3.</description>

      <title>Rashee Rice (hamstring) is practicing in full for Week 14 against the Texans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e671-d90e-a9da-ff7fd0930000</link>
      <description>Isiah Pacheco was also a full participant in Wednesday’s practice. Both players are good to go for Week 14. Coming off an 8-92-2 receiving line versus Dallas, Rice has cemented his spot near the top of the WR1 ranking. Pacheco, on the other hand, only saw three carries to Kareem Hunt’s 14. He cannot be started even in deep fantasy formats.</description>

      <title>Aaron Jones (shoulder) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e674-db57-afda-f676fd4a0000</link>
      <description>Jones suffered a shoulder injury in the Vikings’ Week 13 loss to the Seahawks and is believed to be day-to-day. He gets in a limited practice to begin the week, a good sign he will be ready to suit up Week 14 against the Commanders. If Jones cannot go, Jordan Mason will have the lead back role.</description>

      <title>Vikings opened the 21-day injured reserve activation window for RB Ty Chandler (knee).</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e679-db57-afda-f67bcd270000</link>
      <description>Chandler returned to practice in a limited fashion on Wednesday as the Vikings opened his 21-day window to be activated from injured reserve. He suffered a knee injury in Week 1 and has been on injured reserve since. A limited practice gives Chandler a shot at returning Week 14 against the Commanders; with Aaron Jones (shoulder) also banged up, Chandler could pick up an immediate role on passing downs in his return.</description>

      <title>Geno Smith (foot) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e67e-db57-afda-f67ebd420000</link>
      <description>Smith popped up on the injury report with a foot issues ahead of the Raiders’ Week 14 game against the Broncos. This late in the season, it is likely he is managing some aches and pains and the Raiders are varying his workload. Smith is still on track to play on Sunday, though he is barely a fantasy QB2 this week.</description>

      <title>Raiders WR Dont’e Thornton (concussion) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e687-d90e-a9da-ff8fd6770000</link>
      <description>Thornton is not practicing due to a concussion. The 23-year-old has caught just eight passes this season and has become an afterthought in the pass-catching order. Also not practicing was WR Alex Bachman (thumb), who has primarily been a return specialist this season. Thornton’s potential Week 14 absence does not elevate any other Raiders receiver to be an interesting fantasy play against the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Michael Mayer (ankle) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e68d-d6c4-abfb-f68f8af50000</link>
      <description>Mayer has not been practicing since suffering an ankle injury in Week 12. He missed Week 13 and is not back practicing yet, indicating he is trending to miss Week 14 against the Broncos. Mayer can stay off fantasy radars at this point in the season.</description>

      <title>Chargers QB Justin Herbert said he is going to “prepare as if [he is] going to play” in Week 14 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-e695-d6c4-abfb-f69738570000</link>
      <description>Herbert underwent successful surgery on his left hand earlier this week, ahead of a Week 14 matchup on Monday night against the Eagles. According to the Athletic’s Daniel Popper, he said the fracture on his non-throwing hand successfully “stabilized” and he is preparing to play Monday. Official practice reports from later this week will tell just how ready Herbert will be; given the Chargers have a tough matchup against the Eagles, all Chargers pass-catchers are downgraded even if Herbert plays. Herbert is a shaky fantasy QB2 if he does suit up for Week 14.</description>
