      <title>Panthers HC Dave Canales said he does not have an update on Bryce Young’s ankle injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9313-d45b-affe-d7977eaa0000</link>
      <description>As Panthers beat writer Joe Person notes, this is par for the course for Canales, who doesn’t offer injury updates during Monday’s presser. Young played through his injury in Sunday’s win over the Falcons, and churned out a career-high 448 yards in the victory. It was undoubtedly his best game as a pro, and gave the Panthers a much-needed win as they aim to keep pace with the Buccaneers in the NFC South. Given how he played on Sunday, it seems unlikely that this injury would sideline Young for Week 12’s game against the 49ers, but his status will be one to monitor throughout the week.</description>

      <title>Jets signed DT Khalen Saunders, formerly of the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-931e-d673-a39e-b79fce9c0000</link>
      <description>Saunders had interest from multiple teams, including the Ravens, Colts, and Cardinals. However, to avoid interrupting any plans of an early offseason, the veteran tackle has opted to sign with the Jets. Saunders, 29, has 32 games of starting experience under his belt and totaled 43 tackles, two sacks, and three pass breakups for the Saints last season. He should have a chance to make an immediate impact for the Jets over the final seven weeks of the season.</description>

      <title>Ravens HC John Harbaugh said he is optimistic that Marlon Humphrey (finger) will be able to play in Week 12 against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9354-d45b-affe-d7d641640000</link>
      <description>Humphrey underwent a minor procedure last week that sidelined him for Week 11 against the Browns. He was never expected to miss more than a game or two, so Harbaugh’s early optimism that he could return in Week 12 doesn’t come as a surprise. Humphrey has played on 272 coverage snaps this season, per PFF, breaking up four passes while also forcing one interception.</description>

      <title>Cowboys activated S Malik Hooker from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9365-d45b-affe-d7f7cfed0000</link>
      <description>Hooker hasn’t played since suffering a toe injury in Week 4 against the Packers. Hooker returns to a Cowboys defense that currently ranks 31st in both points and yards allowed, and that has been particularly bad through the air. Hooker has totaled 20 tackles in the four games he has appeared in this season.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan said the team will not open Brandon Aiyuk’s (knee) return window this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9377-d673-a39e-b7f720750000</link>
      <description>The Niners continue to push back the return for Aiyuk, who is still working his way back from the season-ending knee injury he suffered in 2024. 49ers general manager John Lynch said last week that the team still plans to get Aiyuk on the field at some point this season, but the timeline for his return remains a mystery. In addition to Aiyuk, the Niners also said they won’t be opening Jacob Cowing’s return window until after their Week 14 bye. Cowing has been sidelined with a hamstring injury.</description>

      <title>Bengals HC Zac Taylor said Cam Taylor-Britt is likely to need Lisfranc surgery, which would end his season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-937c-d45b-affe-d7fead8a0000</link>
      <description>Taylor-Britt played on only 10 defensive snaps in Week 11’s loss to the Steelers before exiting with a foot injury. If his season is over, Taylor-Britt will have totaled 21 tackles and five pass breakups while earning a PFF coverage grade of 57.0 on 220 coverage snaps.</description>

      <title>Commanders waived K Matt Gay.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9380-d45b-affe-d796bad60000</link>
      <description>Gay was already on the hot seat entering Week 11’s game against the Dolphins. The veteran kicker has gone 9-for-10 on field goal attempts inside of 50 yards this season, but is just 4-for-9 on kicks of 50-plus yards this season. His two missed field goals in Sunday’s loss to the Dolphins were the final straw, with his last miss coming on a wide right attempt from 55 yards out that had plenty of distance to get through. Gay signed a one-year contract with the Commanders this offseason after spending the last two years with the Colts. With the Commanders now entering their bye week, we would expect them to bring on a handful of players to compete for the kicking job ahead of Week 13.</description>

      <title>Bills TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) was listed as a DNP on Monday’s estimated practice report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9388-d713-ad9e-ffdc13a90000</link>
      <description>Kincaid missed Week 11’s game due to his hamstring injury and could be at risk of missing Week 12 due to the short turnaround to prepare for Thursday night. Backup Dawson Knox saw only three targets in place of Kincaid while running a season-high 28 routes, per PFF. Fantasy managers shouldn’t count on Knox as a spot start if Kincaid were to miss another game.</description>

      <title>Panthers coach Dave Canales said there was “a focused effort” to get Xavier Legette more targets on Sunday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9394-d45b-affe-d796a2b40000</link>
      <description>Well, hard to argue with the results after a 4/83/1 line on eight targets against the Falcons helped lead to a 30-points explosion, but a bit of a weird flex since Legette has been useless for most of the fantasy season. This does give Legette some FLEX appeal in Week 12 against the 49ers, but it also comes with the warning that he exited Sunday’s game with a hip injury that bears monitoring this week.</description>

      <title>Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said he’s “not going to get into any of that right now” when asked if there was a level of performance that would lead J.J. McCarthy to get benched.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9398-d713-ad9e-ffdc0f1a0000</link>
      <description>Maybe McCarthy will turn it around next start and maybe these reps are necessary, but it sure feels awkward to watch Sam Darnold perform well again in Seattle while McCarthy putters around needing major fourth-quarter comebacks to crack the 100-yard mark. The fact that media members are already asking about a benching for McCarthy says a lot more than the box score has, and the box scores were already suggesting some dire things about McCarthy’s performance. It’s hard to suggest that an O’Connell-coached quarterback is a true bottom-rung superflex QB2, especially in a week where we’re talking about Shedeur Sanders starting, but the circumstances are whispering it strongly.</description>
