      <title>Dontayvion Wicks (calf) remained limited in practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-165c-d332-a1fd-967e82450000</link>
      <description>Wicks is probably trending to the right side of questionable for Week 1 after getting in two limited sessions to start the week. His Week 1 status will probably depend a lot on what the Friday report tells us, but he could still be a fantasy factor given how dinged up Jayden Reed is.</description>

      <title>Bears RB Kyle Monangai (hamstring) was limited in Thursday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-165d-dbe3-a9bb-365f99750000</link>
      <description>Monangai is currently penciled in as the Bears’ No. 2 RB with Roschon Johnson still sidelined by a foot injury. Seventh-round rookies infrequently carve out roles for themselves but given the state of things, Monangai is worth stashing on fantasy benches. His early-week participation suggests he will play on Monday night.</description>

      <title>Cade Otton (groin) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-165e-db7b-a5dd-b65e652e0000</link>
      <description>It’s an upgrade from Wednesday’s limited listing. Otton appears on track to play in Week 1 after Todd Bowles said he’d “be out for a little bit” last week. He steps into a nice streaming spot against a young Falcons defense that didn’t exactly scare anybody last year, with both Chris Godwin and Jalen McMillan sidelined for Week 1. Otton could be a decent streamer TE1.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Christian Kirk (hamstring) has a strain and is expected to miss Week 1 “and possibly longer.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1662-de13-afdd-56eb7fb90000</link>
      <description>One source of Schefter’s “estimated it to be a two-week injury” for Kirk. It’s wheels up for the young Texans receiving corps, with Jaylin Noel the likely replacement for Kirk in the slot. Noel could be a surprise x-factor in fantasy leagues in Week 1 given this much workload. Jayden Higgins also likely profiles to receive more targets with Kirk removed from the equation.</description>

      <title>Bears CB Jaylon Johnson (calf/groin) was limited in Thursday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1660-d332-a1fd-96767dda0000</link>
      <description>Johnson’s leg issue was initially reported as a hamstring injury, suffered in a “freak accident,” but it was recently reported as a groin injury instead. The calf aspect is entirely new, and we do not know when it happened. The Bears need Johnson on the field if they hope to contain Justin Jefferson in primetime on Monday night, but his status is firmly in the questionable camp despite today’s participation. Bears LB T.J. Edwards (hamstring) and DB Josh Blackwell (Groin) did not practice.</description>

      <title>Noah Brown (knee) remained limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1666-db7b-a5dd-b666f1390000</link>
      <description>Brown has essentially been dealing with this knee injury for the better part of training camp and may be on a pitch count for Week 1 if active. Fantasy managers can probably do better elsewhere, but if Brown gets a Friday upgrade he could still be startable in extremely deep leagues.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1666-db7b-a5dd-b666f1390000</guid>

      <title>Tyreek Hill (oblique/calf) remained limited in Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1669-db7b-a5dd-b66dc1d80000</link>
      <description>Hill doesn’t look to be in any real danger of missing time in Week 1, but playing through yet another set of injuries won’t be doing him any favors in fantasy football. There’s still a good chance he stumbles into plenty of value in Week 1 against a Colts cornerback room that can best be described as “veteran-laden,” but they won’t be playing Indianapolis every week. We’d like to see Hill get a full practice in on Friday to be confident that he’s got it all working, but he’ll be on the WR2/WR3 even if he is questionable on the final injury report.</description>

      <title>De’Von Achane (calf) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1669-d332-a1fd-967fc4fa0000</link>
      <description>Achane is being eased back into action and is on track to play in Week 1 against the Colts. Head coach Mike McDaniel has not been afraid to pile touches high on his stars’ plates when returning from injury. Achane is an RB1 for the occasion, though it would be nice to see him practice in full tomorrow.</description>

      <title>Justin Jefferson (hamstring) is not on the injury report for Week 1 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1699-dbe3-a9bb-36db002a0000</link>
      <description>The Vikings managed Jefferson’s hamstring injury beautifully. He can be trusted to handle elite WR1 duties in primetime on Monday night. Fantasy managers should closely follow the health of Bears No. 1 CB Jaylon Johnson, who was known to be nursing a groin injury but also appeared on Thursday’s injury report with a calf injury. If Johnson is unable to play, Jefferson could take a significant number of snaps against every fantasy manager’s favorite cornerback, Tyrique Stevenson.</description>

      <title>Dolphins S Ashtyn Davis (calf) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-1686-dbe3-a9bb-36d739180000</link>
      <description>Dolphins backup CB Ethan Bonner (hamstring) did not practice and fellow backup DB Elijah Campbell was added to the injury report with a knee injury, suggesting he suffered a new injury in practice. The Dolphins’ secondary was already among the league’s most fantasy-friendly units—but now its depth is in trouble.</description>
