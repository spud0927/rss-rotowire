      <title>Rico Dowdle rushed three times for seven yards and caught 1-of-1 targets for 20 yards in the Panthers’ preseason Week 1 game against the Browns.</title>

      <description>Dowdle could have a fantasy-relevant role this year. He played behind Chuba Hubbard but did split first-team reps with him. Dowdle also notably out-snapped Hubbard two-to-one on third down, taking the first and third qualifying snap.</description>

      <title>Drake Maye complete 3-of-5 passes for 12 yards and rushed two times for 16 yards and one touchdown in the Patriots’ preseason Week 1 game against the Commanders.</title>

      <description>Maye’s day was marred by a sack-fumble that ended the Patriots’ first drive but he made up for it by running for a score. Maye made it look easy on his touchdown scramble, briefly standing tall in the pocket before out-jogging Commanders defenders. He’s a locked-in QB1.</description>

      <title>Kyle Williams caught 0-of-3 targets in the Patriots’ preseason Week 1 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c4e-d05a-adda-aecec9070000</link>
      <description>Williams took first-team reps along with Mack Hollins, DeMario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte. Among the bunch, Williams is the only one who earned a target, though he did so with Joshua Dobbs at quarterback. Williams shook his defender at the Commanders’ five-yard line but Dobbs’ throw was late. Williams, Hollins and Boutte are still jockeying for position on the Patriots’ depth chart.</description>

      <title>TreVeyon Henderson rushed once for 18 yards, caught 3-of-3 targets for 12 yards and returned the opening kickoff for a 100-yard touchdown in the Patriots’ preseason Week 1 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c59-d90d-a5bd-ae5b7c030000</link>
      <description>Henderson established himself as the Patriots’ most explosive player on the very first play, weaving through traffic en route to the 100-yard return touchdown. Rhamondre Stevenson will remain involved in the Patriots’ offense as a north-south rusher but Henderson looks the part of a featured dual-threat weapon. He took four first-team reps to Stevenson’s five.</description>

      <title>Rhamondre Stevenson rushed seven times for 36 yards in the Patriots’ preseason Week 1 game against the Commanders.</title>

      <description>Stevenson ran efficiently with the first team, averaging 5.0 yards per carry. He was outplayed by TreVeyon Henderson, however, who also played with the first-team offense. Stevenson is looking more like an upside-stash than a weekly fantasy contributor.</description>

      <title>Jacory Croskey-Merritt rushed seven times for 24 yards and caught 1-of-1 targets for eight yards in the Commanders’ preseason Week 1 game against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c69-d05a-adda-aeeb5a360000</link>
      <description>The Commanders rested their first-team offense but Croskey-Merritt was on the field as a member of today’s starting group. His performance did not disappoint. “Bill” churned through arm tackles on inside runs and left a would-be tackler diving for air on his cross-field catch-and-run. It’s a good start for the promising rookie.</description>

      <title>Isaac TeSlaa caught 2-of-3 targets for 18 yards and one touchdown in the Lions’ preseason Week 1 game against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c77-d90d-a5bd-ae7fcbd00000</link>
      <description>TeSlaa continued his in-game acrobatics but this time, he produced a highlight-reel touchdown grab against a penciled-in starter. Teslaa snuck past slot CB Dee Alford in the red zone, beautifully high-pointed a pass from QB Easton Stick and retained control of the football as Alford hit him in the air. The athletic rookie is earning more opportunities.</description>

      <title>Shedeur Sanders completed 14-of-23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns and rushed four times for 19 yards in the Browns’ preseason Week 1 game against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c83-d05a-adda-ae835af10000</link>
      <description>Sanders had his ups and downs but looked good completing passes over the middle. He also lost six yards via two sacks. All in all, this was a promising performance for the Browns’ No. 4 quarterback. It should be unsurprising for us to see him challenge Dillon Gabriel for the No. 3 role next week.</description>

      <title>Dylan Sampson rushed two times for six yards and caught 0-of-1 targets in the Browns’ preseason Week 1 game against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c89-d05a-adda-ae8b7fce0000</link>
      <description>Sampson got the start, taking 8-of-9 backfield snaps to begin the game while forcing one missed tackle along the way. Sampson remains a reasonable late-round dart throw, penciled in as the Browns’ No. 2 running back.</description>
