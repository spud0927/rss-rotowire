      <title>Rams hired Kliff Kingsbury to their offensive staff.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-311e-d89c-a1be-bfdfbfce0000</link>
      <description>NFL insider Jordan Schultz broke the news, saying Kingsbury “wants to continue growing as a coach and learn more about what it takes to be a head coach in the NFL again.” This is a smart move. McVay has successfully balanced head-coaching duties while running the Rams’ offense since 2017. He won NFL Coach of the Year in his first season on the job and Super Bowl LVI in 2021. Kingsbury also ran the offense while serving as the Cardinals’ head coach from 2019-2022, though he did so less successfully.</description>

      <title>Ravens hired Harland Bower as their new outside linebackers coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-34b3-d89c-a1be-bfff0f380000</link>
      <description>Bower has served as Duke’s defensive ends coach since 2022. He was a defensive analyst with Texas A&amp;M in 2021. Current Ravens ILB coach Tyler Santucci notably coached Texas A&amp;M linebackers from 2020-2021. Bower’s new role with the Ravens is his first at the NFL level.</description>

      <title>Fernando Mendoza said that he does not think that throwing at the NFL Combine is “going to be a priority.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3502-d89c-a1be-bfdf5f850000</link>
      <description>It sounds like Mendoza does not plan to throw at the NFL Combine, though his statement was not definitive. He adds that he wants to throw at Indiana’s Pro Day with his teammate, in part because he wants to “make sure [he gives his] guys the best chance” to succeed as well. He declined to comment specifically on the idea of joining the Raiders via the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, but had “good things to say about the work Klint Kubiak has done with Sam Darnold in Seattle this year.”</description>

      <title>Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he is “looking forward” to signing George Pickens to a contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3528-d042-afbc-7dfa3a560000</link>
      <description>Jones adds that he wants Pickens to be a Cowboy for “a long time.” We have no doubt this is true, but the Cowboys’ recent contract negotiations with their star players have been volatile, to say the least. In 2024, the front office signed CeeDee Lamb to an extension on August 27th, and waited until mere hours before the Cowboys’ Week 1 game against the Browns to sign Dak Prescott to an extension. Contract talks with Micah Parsons soured to the point that he ended up being traded. A report from NBC Sports’ Pro Football Talk notes that the Cowboys will likely use the franchise tag on Pickens, an impending free agent, “which will buy the sides time to negotiate a long-term deal.”</description>

      <title>Seahawks S Nick Emmanwori (ankle) is not on the injury report for Super Bowl LX against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3534-d355-a5bd-bf748cd40000</link>
      <description>The Seahawks had Emmanwori take the day off to receive treatment on Thursday, after spraining his ankle on Wednesday. Emmanwori suffered a high-ankle sprain in September and sprained the same ankle this week, but imaging indicated he avoided a high-ankle sprain this time. He practiced fully today, which is a great sign for his readiness to play a normal allotment of snaps on Sunday. Seahawks LT Charles Cross (foot) was also cleared to play after practicing fully today.</description>

      <title>Seahawks QB Sam Darnold (oblique) is not on the injury report for Super Bowl LX against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-311f-d629-a1bc-b11f34fa0000</link>
      <description>Up until Thursday, Darnold had been a limited practice participant since injuring his oblique during the Seahawks’ final Divisional Round practice. As of Friday evening, he has two full sessions under his belt. Last time we saw Darnold on the field, he threw for a season-high 346 yards and three touchdowns. He is good to go for Sunday’s game.</description>

      <title>Patriots QB Drake Maye (shoulder) is not on the injury report for Super Bowl LX against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3564-d355-a5bd-bf7433de0000</link>
      <description>Maye injured his right, throwing shoulder in the Patriots’ AFC Championship Game victory over the Broncos. He was limited through last week’s first two practices before being sidelined on Friday by an illness. After resting and rehabbing through the weekend, he rattled off three straight full practice sessions this week. This year’s MVP runner-up is ready to go.</description>

      <title>Patriots LB Robert Spillane (ankle) is questionable for Super Bowl LX against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3567-d355-a5bd-bf77d5cd0000</link>
      <description>Spillane got in two limited sessions to close the week, which is a good sign. The veteran linebacker aggravated an ankle injury in the AFC Championship Game that initially sidelined him in Weeks 14-18. Patriots LB Harold Landry (knee) was limited on Wednesday, sat out on Thursday and resumed practicing in a limited capacity on Friday.</description>

      <title>Texans defensive pass game coordinator Cory Undlin and DB coach Dino Vasso are candidates for the Browns’ defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3572-d355-a5bd-bf7686170000</link>
      <description>The report comes from NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, who notes that the Texans run the same defensive scheme as the Browns. Browns DC Jim Schwartz resigned yesterday. Undlin spent 2015-2019 coaching defensive backs with the Eagles. Schwartz ran the Eagles’ defense from 2016-2020. Vasso signed on with the Eagles as a defensive quality control coach and assistant secondary coach in 2016. He was promoted to the title of assistant coordinator/defense in 2020.</description>

      <title>Nakobe Dean said he “hopes” to re-sign with the Eagles this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3570-d629-a1bc-b57d8c020000</link>
      <description>The former third-round pick is a talented, yet oft-injured player. He has missed multiple games in each of his first four seasons. Dean was unable to play until Week 7 this year after suffering a torn patellar tendon in the 2024 postseason. He later missed Weeks 17 and 18 with a hamstring injury. Through four regular seasons, Dean has totaled 166 tackles, eight sacks and one interception.</description>
