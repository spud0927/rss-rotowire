      <title>Steelers TE Darnell Washington is in the NFL’s concussion protocol.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0431-d77b-adfb-ceb39acd0000</link>
      <description>Washington left Week 14’s win over the Ravens with a head injury and did not return. If he’s unable to clear the protocol before the Steelers’ Week 15 Monday night game against Miami, Pat Freiermuth would likely operate as the team’s primary pass-catching tight end. Freiermuth could be a nice deep league streaming option while Jonnu Smith — who has five receptions over his past five games — should remain on waiver wires.</description>

      <title>Colts signed QB Philip Rivers to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0443-da9b-a9bf-de4fa1e90000</link>
      <description>Unprecedented amounts of desperation are being shown here as the Colts try to keep their playoff hopes alive. It’s almost impossible to know how well Rivers will play as he’s been retired since the end of the 2020 season, but it’s hard to believe the Colts signed him without a promise that he’d be active at the very least, if not playing against the Seahawks in Week 15. We’d offer a conservative “he’s probably a QB3 in superflex leagues” take if he starts, but Rivers didn’t exactly have sterling athleticism at the end of his career either and it’s possible he could wind up a usable QB2.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers placed G Ben Bredeson (knee) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0477-da9b-a9bf-de7fd7570000</link>
      <description>He’ll miss the remainder of the regular season, though he could come back for the playoffs if the Buccaneers are able to hold off the Panthers for the NFC South crown. Bredeson had a 77.0 PFF pass block grade in 622 snaps for Tampa Bay this year while dealing with a few different injuries. He’s under contract through 2027.</description>

      <title>Ravens signed G Laken Tomlinson to their practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-04ee-d77b-adfb-ceefd7410000</link>
      <description>Released by the Texans last week, Tomlinson joins a Ravens team that has shuffled around bodies at guard of late. It’s possible he gets elevated at some point down the stretch. They released EDGE Carl Lawson from the practice squad to free up the spot to add Tomlinson.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-04ee-d77b-adfb-ceefd7410000</guid>

      <title>Browns placed RB Jerome Ford (shoulder) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-04f3-d8cf-affb-bcfb3d4c0000</link>
      <description>He’ll miss the next four games, so unless he works out some sort of injury settlement with the team, Ford’s season is over. He managed 24 carries for 73 yards as Cleveland’s third-down back early in the season , but his playing time gradually dwindled, never receiving more than 17 snaps in a game after Week 6. Brown will enter free agency this offseason and likely will draw some interest as a third-down back, but he’s not much of a fantasy asset as this stage of his career.</description>

      <title>49ers released K Matt Gay.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0529-d77b-adfb-cfabed780000</link>
      <description>Gay made four field goals and four extra points without missing a kick in two games for the 49ers. But starter Eddy Pinero is healthy enough to be active again, and so the 49ers will move on. Gay joins the workout kicker circuit again and figures to get a third opportunity at some point in the last month of the season.</description>

      <title>Texans claimed DT Naquan Jones off waivers from the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0547-d77b-adfb-cfc768120000</link>
      <description>The 2021 UDFA was waived Monday to make room on the game day roster for the return of Omarion Hampton. Jones will be a rotational piece for the Texans after they lost Tim Settle for the remainder of the season. They waived Jalen Mills to create space for Jones.</description>

      <title>Falcons WR Drake London (knee) did not participate in Tuesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0568-d8cf-affb-bd6a441e0000</link>
      <description>London was the only Falcons player listed with a DNP status on Tuesday after head coach Raheem Morris called the 24-year-old “day to day” on Monday. It is unlikely London will be ready to go on a short week ahead of a Thursday game against the Buccaneers, even if he practices in some capacity on Wednesday. London is on the wrong side of questionable as he continues to take time healing from a pesky PCL sprain.</description>

      <title>Falcons TE Kyle Pitts (knee) was limited in Tuesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-056e-da9b-a9bf-df6f9fc30000</link>
      <description>Pitts was listed as a limited participant for the second straight day with a knee issue. The 25-year-old has seen 18 targets over the last two games with Kirk Cousins at quarterback and figures to continue operating as the offense’s top pass-catcher with Drake London (knee) still working his way back. Fantasy managers should stay tuned for Pitts’ final injury listing on Wednesday, but the limited listings at least indicate it is not a serious issue ahead of a Thursday matchup against the Bucs.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers LT Tristan Wirfs (oblique) was limited in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0575-d005-a9bf-dd75c8f80000</link>
      <description>Wirfs missed Week 14 against the Saints with an oblique injury. He is listed as a limited participant for both Monday and Tuesday as head coach Todd Bowles said the franchise left tackle could play Thursday against the Falcons. Another practice on Wednesday will give us more confidence that Wirfs will be back protecting Baker Mayfield’s blindside in Week 15.</description>
