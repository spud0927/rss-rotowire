      <title>Saints signed CB Dalys Beanum, CB Beanie Bishop Jr, WR Elijah Cooks, S Elliott Davison, DT Coziah Izzard, OT Easton Kilty, CB Jayden Price, and OT Barry Wesley to reserve/futures contracts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-908c-d56e-afff-f6ec1f3d0000</link>
      <description>Cooks appeared in 11 games for the Jaguars during the 2023 and 2024 season, catching a combined 3-of-4 targets for 38 yards. He’ll look to break out in camp and preseason after change of scenery.</description>

      <title>Broncos signed QB Sam Ehlinger to the 53-man roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9090-dc7a-af9b-dfbfda090000</link>
      <description>Ehlinger was not elevated for Week 18 while still having one standard elevation remaining, but will now head into the postseason a member of the 53-man, game-day roster. It’ll give the Broncos additional maneuverability during what they hope is a long playoff run as the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The veteran backup chose not to sign with the Colts following the injury to Daniel Jones and was reported to have had discussions with the Broncos regarding their plans moving forward. “We’ve talked about some things for the playoffs,” Ehlinger said ahead of Week 18, hinting at the move made official Monday.</description>

      <title>NFL reinstated suspended Steelers WR DK Metcalf and suspended Chargers LB Denzel Perryman.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9096-dc7a-af9b-dfbfe4960000</link>
      <description>Metcalf was suspended for two games for throwing a punch at a fan in Week 16 while Perryman was suspended for the same timeframe for repeated player safety violations following a helmet-to-helmet hit on Cowboys WR Ryan Flournoy. Both players were reinstated as their respective teams prepare for the postseason, meaning they are cleared to practice ahead of the Wildcard Round.</description>

      <description>GM Joe Schoen’s first act after being retained by the team was to sign six practice squad players to reserve/futures contracts. We’re sure this is the right move for the team’s future.</description>

      <title>Commanders LB Von Miller said he wants to play another year and remain with the Commanders.</title>

      <description>Miller will be 37 in March but said he wants to return for a 17th professional season, also stating that he hopes to remain in Washington. “Whoever wants me, that’s where I’ll be,” the veteran continued, stating that he understand he is no position to be making demands considering his age. Either way, Miller seems intent on playing again in 2026.</description>

      <title>Panthers activated WR David Moore (elbow) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9386-d35e-a1bf-d7c6398f0000</link>
      <description>The veteran wideout has been on injured reserve since the end of September with a serious elbow injury, but could return for the postseason as the Panthers prepare to take on the heavily-favored Rams this weekend. The Panthers in a corresponding move waived veteran journeyman Hunter Renfrow, who had 25 receptions for 255 yards and two touchdowns for Carolina in 2025.</description>

      <description>Renfrow, who was a big part of the Carolina passing offense in the season’s first couple weeks, hasn’t been active since mid-October. He ends the season with 25 receptions for 255 yards and two touchdowns, operating mostly from the slot. Renfrow, who has 103 catches for the Raiders in 2021, will likely catch on with a receiver-needy team this offseason.</description>

      <title>Falcons requested an interview with Bears assistant GM Ian Cunningham for the team’s general manager vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9390-d35e-a1bf-d7d259c70000</link>
      <description>Cunningham, whose career in NFL front offices including stints working closely with Howie Roseman and Ozzie Newsome, is considered a strong candidate to be Atlanta’s next general manager after the team fired former GM Terry Fontenot after a series of catastrophic draft picks and team-building decisions, including drafting Kyle Pitts and Michael Penix. Cunningham reportedly came close last year to landing the Jaguars GM job. He could join Matt Ryan, the Falcons’ new president of football operations, in rebuilding the Falcons.</description>
