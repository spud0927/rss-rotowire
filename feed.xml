      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports a source familiar with the situation said Sauce Garder will likely miss “a few weeks” due to his calf injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-da96-db57-afda-deb658d90000</link>
      <description>Gardner is undergoing additional tests to determine the exact severity of the injury, but as Fowler notes, Gardner seems to have avoided a major injury. We’ll likely get a clearer timeline on Gardner’s impending absence in the next 24 hours or so, but it sounds like he’ll be a lock to miss Week 14’s game against the Jaguars, and perhaps Week 15’s game against the Seahawks. In three games with the Colts this season, Gardner has totaled 13 tackles and two pass breakups while holding opposing receivers to 38 yards on 10 targets.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Sauce Gardner is considered week-to-week after an MRI revealed he suffered a calf strain in Week 13’s loss to the Texans.</title>

      <description>It’s the best Gardner and the Colts could have hoped for after the initial injury appeared to be much worse on the field. Gardner will miss a few weeks with what is officially being diagnosed as a strained calf, but according to Rapoport, the Colts hope to have him back before the end of the regular season. Barring an unexpected turn of events, Gardner should avoid a stint on injured reserve. Mekhi Blackmon is listed behind him on the depth chart and should step in to replace Gardner during his absence.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Steelers LB Patrick Queen is believed to have suffered a lower back bruise in Week 13’s loss to the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-dac1-d90e-a9da-dfcf60400000</link>
      <description>It’s quite a shift from the hip injury this was initially classified as, but Queen is undergoing further tests to determine the specifics of his injury. According to Rapoport, the Steelers hope Queen’s injury isn’t something long-term, but it sounds like he could be sidelined for at least one game. Queen and the Steelers have a pivotal Week 14 matchup against the Ravens on tap as they battle for supremacy in the down bad AFC North. If he’s unable to go, Malik Harrison would be the next man up on the depth chart.</description>

      <title>Patriots added C Garrett Bradbury (illness) to the injury report ahead of Week 13’s game against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-dacf-d90e-a9da-dfcf51ec0000</link>
      <description>Bradbury is now considered questionable for Monday night’s tilt with the Giants. With the Patriots already down rookie offensive tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson, the team can ill-afford to lose a third starter along the line. The good news is that players listed with illnesses tend to play through those things more often than not. In the event he can’t go, however, Ben Brown would be next in line to fill his spot.</description>

      <title>Vikings waived WR Adam Thielen.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-dada-d82c-a79a-fbdeeeb10000</link>
      <description>Thielen was a healthy scratch in Week 13. In a statement released by the team, the decision to release Thielen was “out of respect for Adam,” who hopes to secure a bigger role elsewhere in what he has said will be his final NFL season. The Vikings traded a 2026 fifth-round pick and a 2027 fourth-round pick for Thielen in hopes of bolstering their receiving corps while Jordan Addison served a three-game suspension. We’ll see where things go from here, but 35-year-old receivers are seldom in high demand at this point in the season, and Thielen only caught eight passes for 69 scoreless yards in 11 games with the Vikings this season. It’s possible he finds a role on a contender in the coming days, but we wouldn’t expect Thielen to be much more than added depth wherever he lands next.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers HC Todd Bowles said “it’s a possibility” that Mike Evans (collarbone) practices this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-daf6-db57-afda-def65a320000</link>
      <description>Evans suffered a broken collarbone in Week 7 against the Lions. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported shortly after that Evans could miss “eight weeks or fewer,” and the veteran receiver has now been sidelined for the better part of six weeks. The Buccaneeers would need to designate Evans for a return before he takes to the practice field, which would still give the team 21 days before activating him or ruling him out for the season. Evans could still be a few weeks away from being game-ready, but with the Buccaneers sitting on a 7-5 record and in the thick of a playoff race, his return would be a welcome addition to the offense.</description>

      <title>Browns HC Kevin Stefanski said Maliek Collins will miss the remainder of the season due to a quad injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-db14-d90e-a9da-df1f4c530000</link>
      <description>Collins was carted from the field in the third quarter of the Browns’ Week 13 loss to the 49ers and will now miss the remainder of the season. Collins is expected to undergo surgery in the coming days. The 10-year vet has been playing at a high level in his first year with the Browns, notching a career-high 6.5 sacks in the 12 games he’s appeared in while also totaling 25 tackles, seven TFLs, and 13 QB hits. Collins joined the Browns on a two-year, $20 million contract this offseason and should be ready in time for the start of training camp next season.</description>

      <title>Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said Sam Darnold (ankle) “should be good to go” for Week 14.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-db15-d6c4-abfb-df178d0f0000</link>
      <description>We might see him pop up on the injury report ahead of Week 14’s matchup with the Falcons for maintenance reasons. Darnold spent some time in the medical tent against the Vikings on Sunday. He’ll be a risky start in one-quarterback leagues against a solid Falcons pass defense.</description>

      <title>Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said J.J. McCarthy (concussion) will “have an opportunity to play next week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-db1b-d6c4-abfb-df1b2ded0000</link>
      <description>He can be cleared from concussion protocol as soon as Monday. The Commanders would represent a step down in competition for McCarthy (or Max Brosmer) after two rounds in the Packers-Seahawks torture chamber, but neither of these players can be reliably started in superflex leagues given how poor they and the Vikings offense have been of late.</description>

      <title>Aaron Jones is believed to be day-to-day after suffering a shoulder injury in Week 13’s loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-db1d-d6c4-abfb-df1fea540000</link>
      <description>According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Jones “is likely to be considered day-to-day” with his injury. Jones exited in the third quarter of Sunday’s shutout loss to the Seahawks and didn’t return to the field. The phrasing in Schefter’s report suggests the Vikings are still waiting to get a final word on Jones’ injury, but it sounds like he avoided the worst. If he is day-to-day, Jones will have a chance to suit up in Week 14 when the Vikings face the Commanders this week, but if he’s unable to go, we can expect Jordan Mason to step into a lead role with Zavier Scott likely working in on passing downs.</description>
