      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports Cardinals could move on from QB Kyler Murray this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f44e-d005-a9bf-fc7edabe0000</link>
      <description>Russini writes that executives around the league wouldn’t be surprised if Murray is on the move this offseason. Murray’s contract will complicate matters given his nearly $60 million dead cap hit next year and almost $40 million in guaranteed money. Still, Russini suggests the Cardinals could opt to release Murray in the unlikely scenario where they can’t find a trade partner. Even before Murray got hurt this year, the writing was on the wall that this marriage wasn’t working out. Now that he’s been ruled out for the year by coach Jonathan Gannon, it’s increasingly likely he’s played his final snaps with the Cardinals.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Chargers RB Omarion Hampton (ankle) “should be” activated for Week 14’s matchup with the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f48a-d8cf-affb-fcaaeedf0000</link>
      <description>Hampton practiced in full on Friday and Fowler passes along that the Chargers feel good about his progress. The 22-year-old running back appears to be on the right side of questionable. Hampton is an RB2 against the Eagles in Week 14.</description>

      <title>Colts elevated K Blake Grupe from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4ab-d005-a9bf-fcbf1a6a0000</link>
      <description>Grupe will be the kicker for the Colts in Week 14 against the Jaguars. The 27-year-old gets first crack at being the kicker for Indianapolis after the team released Michael Badgley following his missed extra point against the Texans in Week 13.</description>

      <title>Jordan Schultz of The Schultz Report reports that Omarion Hampton (ankle) will play in Week 14 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4d4-da9b-a9bf-fedd64bb0000</link>
      <description>Hampton will come off injured reserve for his first game since he suffered his ankle injury against the Commanders in Week 5. The 22-year-old first-round selection may see a more limited snap count in his first game back, but he’s in the RB2 range for the Monday Night Football tilt against an Eagles team that gave up 281 rushing yards to the Bears in their previous contest.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4d4-da9b-a9bf-fedd64bb0000</guid>

      <title>Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that the Jets are signing CB Jordan Clark to the active roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4d9-da9b-a9bf-fedd4b800000</link>
      <description>Clark has been on the practice squad, but with Jarvis Brownlee Jr. out with a hip injury, the Jets could turn to the 24-year-old as a potential nickel option for Week 14 against the Dolphins.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4d9-da9b-a9bf-fedd4b800000</guid>

      <title>Justin Herbert (hand) is questionable for Week 14 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f51f-d77b-adfa-ff9fa27e0000</link>
      <description>Herbert is expected to play, but the questionable tag suggests that it’s far from a lock. The 27-year-old signal-caller suffered a fracture on his non-throwing hand against the Raiders in Week 13, but assuming there are no setbacks, he should be under center for Monday Night Football against the Eagles.</description>

      <title>Steelers elevated WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f543-d8cf-affb-fd6b279f0000</link>
      <description>Valdes-Scantling is on his third organization, and will have a chance to make his Steelers’ debut after signing with the team early in November. The 31-year-old wideout has familiarity with Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh wideout corps aren’t exactly spectacular, but it’s hard to invision much fantasy upside for the remainder of 2025.</description>

      <title>Saints elevated K Charlie Smyth from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f54f-d8cf-affb-fd6fc8050000</link>
      <description>Smyth nailed a 56-yard field goal in his NFL debut in Week 13, and the product of Ireland will once again handle kicking duties for the Saints in Week 14 against the Buccaneers. His strong leg and New Orleans’ inability to complete drives makes him worthy of consideration for those who get added points for lengthier field goals.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f54f-d8cf-affb-fd6fc8050000</guid>

      <title>Chiefs signed S Mike Edwards from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f555-d8cf-affb-fd7f6af60000</link>
      <description>Edwards, 29, made his first appearance of the season against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving, and the former starter will be a depth option for Kansas City in their Week 14 tilt against the Texans.</description>

      <title>Hassan Haskins (hamstring) is questionable for Week 14 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f568-d8cf-affb-fd6ac8a20000</link>
      <description>Haskins is currently on injured reserve with his hamstring issue, and hasn’t been able to play since Week 7. The former fourth-round pick would be a backup — presumably for Omarion Hampton (ankle) — option if he can go Monday night against the Eagles.</description>
