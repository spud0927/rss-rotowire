      <title>ESPN’s Tony Grossi reports Browns QB Dillon Gabriel (hamstring) is expected to be “full go” in Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a8f4-d45c-a7fc-aafe63f60000</link>
      <description>Gabriel has been dealing with a hamstring injury for over a week. He has been getting in some reps during team drills and now appears to be back at full strength. Gabriel is in line to start the Browns’ second preseason game versus the Eagles if he makes it to Saturday without any setbacks. With Shedeur Sanders and Kenny Pickett both sidelined because of injuries, Gabriel will get plenty of playing time if he’s active.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Rashee Rice’s disciplinary hearing is scheduled for September 30.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a90f-d90d-a5bd-ab5f4b2e0000</link>
      <description>Rice was sentenced to five years of probation and 30 days in jail for his involvement in a multi-car crash in Dallas over a year ago. The ruling allowed the NFL to move forward with its disciplinary process, which will now take place after Week 4. Rice is expected to be given a multi-game suspension, though estimates for how long that will be range from two to eight games. No matter the length, it’s unlikely the suspension prevents him from playing in the fantasy playoffs. Fantasy managers should still expect to be without him for roughly four games.</description>

      <title>49ers placed OT Andre Dillard on season-ending injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a918-d05a-adda-ab9ad60f0000</link>
      <description>San Francisco placed Dillard on the PUP list ahead of training camp. Dillard underwent offseason ankle surgery and was still recovering from the procedure. He came off the PUP list earlier this week. It’s unclear if he suffered a setback or if this is a new issue. Either way, the 49ers are down a potential swing tackle as the season approaches.</description>

      <title>Commanders signed CB Daryl Worley, formerly of the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a938-d45c-a7fc-ab3a65a90000</link>
      <description>The team also signed journeyman wide receiver River Cracraft. Worley signed with the Titans midseason and ultimately made nine appearances with the team, seven of which were credited as starts. He broke up two passes with one interception and contributed some on special teams. Worley will be a depth option for the Commanders.</description>

      <title>Bills signed DE Nelson Ceaser, formerly of the Seahawks, to a contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a992-d90d-a5bd-abdb99ed0000</link>
      <description>Ceaser logged zero snaps in his 2024 rookie season. The Bills correspondingly waived WR Jalen Virgil and DE Justin Hollins with injury designations. The Athletic’s Joe Buscaglia writes, “Virgil was quite limited during Wednesday’s practice, while Hollins was not on the field for the session.”</description>

      <title>The Commanders worked out free agent OT Cam Fleming on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a99a-d05a-adda-ab9a57710000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reports that Fleming left without a deal but the two sides “plan to remain in touch moving forward.” The 32-year-old offensive tackle most recently played for the Broncos in 2024, earning a 71.3 PFF pass-blocking grade on 80 qualifying snaps.</description>

      <title>Bears head coach Ben Johnson said CB Jaylon Johnson and CB Kyler Gordon are dealing with hamstring injuries.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a994-d90d-a5bd-abdf61630000</link>
      <description>It took a while for the team to disclose both players’ injuries but now we know why they are sidelined. Marquee Sports Network’s Scott Bair reports that the Bears “hope” Johnson is “healthy and can return for the Week 1 clash with the NFC North rival Minnesota Vikings.” Gordon is considered week-to-week, and “the Bears are hopeful that he can return before the end of training camp.” Backup CB Tre Flowers left practice early on Thursday. This secondary could be one to target for fantasy purposes in Week 1.</description>

      <title>Matt Breida announced his retirement after seven seasons in the NFL.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a995-d45c-a7fc-ab9f3da90000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports that the Dolphins recently asked Breida to come in for a workout, but he declined. Breida spent his first three seasons in the NFL with the 49ers, one season apiece with the Dolphins and Bills, and two with the Giants. He did not play in the NFL last year. Over the course of his career, Breida rushed 575 times for 2,652 yards and nine touchdowns and caught 120-of-154 targets for 935 yards and six touchdowns.</description>

      <title>Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said most starters will not play in the team’s preseason Week 2 game against the Buccaneers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a9b9-d05a-adda-abbbd7d40000</link>
      <description>Per NBC Sports’ ProFootballTalk, “players like Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith, Jalen Ramsey, and Cam Heyward,” among others, will not play this weekend. The Steelers will instead use joint practices with the Buccaneers to get the starters valuable reps. Tomlin adds that Ramsey will get all of the reps against Mike Evans today.</description>

      <title>Marquee Sports Networks Scott Bair writes, Olamide Zaccheaus “has been so good that rookie Luther Burden III can’t crack the first team.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-a9d2-d45c-a7fc-abdacd600000</link>
      <description>Per Bair, Olamide “has shown flashes every day of an excellent training camp to this point” and “it’s crystal clear” that Zaccheaus has Caleb Williams’ trust. The Bears’ team-released unofficial depth chart notably shows the team in 12 personnel (two WRs, two TEs, one RB), with DJ Moore and Rome Odunze listed as the two starters. Burden’s raw talent is not in question but Zaccheaus’ presence, coupled with the Bears’ potential 12 personnel reliance, is muddying his path to early-season playing time. Producing a standout showing in the team’s preseason Week 2 game against the Bills would be very helpful for Burden.</description>
