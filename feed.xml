      <title>ESPN’s Michael DiRocco believes Brian Thomas Jr.'s stats “may not reach what they were in 2024.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-85b4-d042-afbc-fdf659e50000</link>
      <description>Rest assured that Thomas will be “a key piece of head coach Liam Cohen’s offense,” but DiRocco seems to believe that Thomas’ complementary role will endure in 2026. DiRocco also notes that Thomas looked uncomfortable in training camp, setting the scene for an ugly early-season run. Thomas has had plenty of trade buzz from the outside this offseason, but a trade probably relies on another team evaluating him at his 2024 level rather than his 2025 level. If he remains in Jacksonville, it’s hard to count on him as more than a WR3 pick in 2026.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Rich Cimini believes the Cardinals could be a “potential suitor” for RB Breece Hall.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-85cf-d629-a1bc-b5df04b70000</link>
      <description>Cimini connects these dots through new head coach Mike LaFleur, who coached Hall with the Jets. Arizona’s backfield is in a major state of flux after all of last season’s backs (James Conner, Trey Benson, Zonovan Knight) suffered season-ending injuries. It’s a vacuum where Hall would make sense. Cimini believes the Jets would like to extend Hall before he hits the open market, but may wind up using the franchise or transition tags instead — or on the way to — a deal.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Kris Rhim believes the Chargers could “make a push” to sign Ravens C Tyler Linderbaum in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-85d5-d629-a1bc-b5dd63c60000</link>
      <description>The Chargers do not often dip outside of GM Joe Hortiz’s preferred free agency lanes, but Rhim speculates it might be different for the former Ravens center who Hortiz helped draft in 2022. The Chargers definitely have a need at the position as Bradley Bozeman has been outclassed the last few years. Linderbaum would do a lot to help fix an interior line that has just never come together. But this does rely on the Chargers doing something they haven’t really done under Hortiz yet: spending big in free agency.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Nick Wagoner believes “it’s reasonable” to think George Kittle (Achilles) could return in Week 5 “or so.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-85fe-d629-a1bc-b5ffa7d80000</link>
      <description>Wagoner’s long piece on Kittle’s injury is rooted in the idea that Kittle’s Achilles tear was “clean” and “happened high up by his soleus,” meaning the blood flow wasn’t as poor as it could be during the recovery. Kittle did not entirely rule out the idea of being ready for Week 1. We’d be surprised if a tight end entering his age-33 season was ready for Week 1, but we’ve learned not to count out any wild physical feats from Kittle. This timeline makes him a little more interesting in 2026 best ball, at the very least.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Nick Kosmider expects the Broncos to “explore multiple other options” before attempting to re-sign J.K. Dobbins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-8612-d629-a1bc-b61f0c5b0000</link>
      <description>As well as Dobbins played, this makes plenty of sense. The Broncos stumbled into him in post-draft free agency — he was no primary target — and he (as usual) missed a huge chunk of last season with an injury. With the Russell Wilson cap hold gone, the Broncos could be a sneaky threat for the bigger-name running backs in free agency in 2026. Kosmider does say it would not be “shocking” if Dobbins eventually comes back, but he’s not a priority.</description>

      <title>Broncos hired John Morton as their new pass game coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-86fe-d629-a1bc-b6ff8e2d0000</link>
      <description>Morton served as the Broncos’ pass game coordinator in 2023 and 2024 before accepting the Lions’ offensive coordinator role in 2025. He was relieved of play-calling duties in-season last year and fired in early January. The Broncos then brought him aboard as an offensive consultant for the playoffs.</description>

      <title>Raiders hired Mario Jeberaeel as their new run game coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-8709-d042-afbc-ffdb55c90000</link>
      <description>Jeberaeel has coached in the NFL for five seasons, spending the last two seasons with the Jaguars and the three before that with the Falcons. He got started with the latter team as a diversity coaching intern and offensive line coach in 2021. He served as the assistant offensive line coach in 2022 before becoming a special projects coach on defense. The Jaguars hired him as an assistant outside linebackers coach in 2024. He spent 2025 working as a defensive assistant.</description>

      <title>NBC Sports’ Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio reports there is a “belief in league circles” that the Jets will apply the transition tag to RB Breece Hall.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-873e-d990-a1de-ef7ee07c0000</link>
      <description>The 2026 transition tag for running backs is expected to fall between $11.5 million and $11.9 million. Applying this tag would allow Hall to shop the contract around the NFL. If another team ups the offer, the Jets will have the chance to match the new offer. Florio notes, however, if the Jets decline to match the new offer, Hall’s departure would not count toward the “next year’s slate of compensatory draft picks” because he is not leaving the team via the typical free agency fashion. If the Jets “catch wind” of a potentially serious suitor, they can rescind the transition tag before an official counteroffer is made, rendering Hall a free agent and restoring his compensatory pick viability. Perhaps the seemingly disgruntled running back will be playing elsewhere in 2026.</description>

      <title>New York Post’s Vincent Bonsignore believes the Rams could draft a developmental quarterback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft’s first round.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-877a-d042-afbc-fffa71800000</link>
      <description>Matthew Stafford, 38, is entrenched as the 2026 starter. Bonsignore writes that “the Rams are already planning for that inevitable transition” that will occur whenever Stafford chooses to retire. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza is unlikely to be available when the Rams are on the clock with the 13th and 29th first-round picks. Bonsignore singles out Alabama QB Ty Simpson as an option for the Rams, while noting that they will likely take a look at Penn State QB Drew Allar, Miami QB Carson Beck, Arkansas QB Taylen Green, Georgia Tech QB Haynes King, Clemson QB Cade Klubnik and LSU QB Garrett Nussmeier at the upcoming NFL Scouting Combine.</description>

      <title>NFL competition committee co-chairman Rich McKay said the committee has received zero requests to ban the Tush Push thus far this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-87a2-d89c-a1be-afff08a90000</link>
      <description>Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts fumbled on a Tush Push attempt in Philadelphia’s 24-15, Week 13 loss to the Bears. He told reporters after the game that it is “becoming tougher and tougher” to run the play. Teams are having more success against it, defensively, than they did previously, while others have begun successfully running it themselves. Seahawks TE AJ Barner moonlighted as a Tush Push quarterback this season. Per PFF, Barner picked up one touchdown and nine first downs on 11 rushing attempts across the full NFL season. It is still possible for teams to submit a ban proposal, but at this point, McKay does not “envision it” happening this offseason.</description>
