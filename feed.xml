      <title>Bills claimed S Darnell Savage off waivers from the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f097-da9b-a9bf-fe9f0e130000</link>
      <description>The Bills placed CB Darius Slay on the reserve/did not report list earlier today, so Savage’s addition makes sense. Savage has played for both the Jaguars and Commanders this season, logging one pass breakup, 13 tackles and two quarterback pressures.</description>

      <title>Broncos WR Pat Bryant (hamstring) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 14 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f0a3-d005-a9bf-f8b7ed380000</link>
      <description>Bryant’s youthful hamstring is evidently good to go. The rookie wide receiver was added to Thursday’s injury report as a limited participant. He remained limited on Friday as well. The soft tissue injury adds volatility to his outlook, but he is a decent bet to earn a moderate single-digit target sum on Sunday.</description>

      <title>Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer said WR CeeDee Lamb (concussion) “had a good day” on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f0f2-d005-a9bf-f8f6d1980000</link>
      <description>Lamb still has to get through the NFL’s concussion protocol, but this is nice to hear. Allowing the symptoms to abate through rest and rehab is key. Players frequently miss at least one game after entering the protocol, but the added rest time afforded to Lamb thanks to the Cowboys’ Week 14 Thursday Night Football game could help him take the field in Week 15 against the Vikings.</description>

      <title>Raiders QB Geno Smith (foot) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 14 against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f11e-d005-a9bf-f93ee2bf0000</link>
      <description>Smith practiced fully on Thursday and Friday, which is a good sign. The error-prone quarterback cannot be started in single-quarterback leagues and is barely on the QB2 radar, given the tough matchup. Tight ends have had success against the Broncos this season, so hopefully, Smith locks onto TE Brock Bowers.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports Chargers QB Justin Herbert (hand) is expected to play against the Eagles in Week 14.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f227-d8cf-affb-fe2f74660000</link>
      <description>It’s been trending this way all week with Herbert participating on a limited basis in practice. The 27-year-old quarterback fractured a finger that required surgery on his non-throwing hand against the Raiders in Week 13. The Chargers have publicly maintained optimism around Herbert’s availability throughout the week. Still listed as questionable, Herbert is expected to play against the Eagles in Week 14.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports Cardinals could move on from QB Kyler Murray this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f44e-d005-a9bf-fc7edabe0000</link>
      <description>Russini writes that executives around the league wouldn’t be surprised if Murray is on the move this offseason. Murray’s contract will complicate matters given his nearly $60 million dead cap hit next year and almost $40 million in guaranteed money. Still, Russini suggests the Cardinals could opt to release Murray in the unlikely scenario where they can’t find a trade partner. Even before Murray got hurt this year, the writing was on the wall that this marriage wasn’t working out. Now that he’s been ruled out for the year by coach Jonathan Gannon, it’s increasingly likely he’s played his final snaps with the Cardinals.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Chargers RB Omarion Hampton (ankle) “should be” activated for Week 14’s matchup with the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f48a-d8cf-affb-fcaaeedf0000</link>
      <description>Hampton practiced in full on Friday and Fowler passes along that the Chargers feel good about his progress. The 22-year-old running back appears to be on the right side of questionable. Hampton is an RB2 against the Eagles in Week 14.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f48a-d8cf-affb-fcaaeedf0000</guid>

      <title>Colts elevated K Blake Grupe from the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4ab-d005-a9bf-fcbf1a6a0000</link>
      <description>Grupe will be the kicker for the Colts in Week 14 against the Jaguars. The 27-year-old gets first crack at being the kicker for Indianapolis after the team released Michael Badgley following his missed extra point against the Texans in Week 13.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4ab-d005-a9bf-fcbf1a6a0000</guid>

      <title>Jordan Schultz of The Schultz Report reports that Omarion Hampton (ankle) will play in Week 14 against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4d4-da9b-a9bf-fedd64bb0000</link>
      <description>Hampton will come off injured reserve for his first game since he suffered his ankle injury against the Commanders in Week 5. The 22-year-old first-round selection may see a more limited snap count in his first game back, but he’s in the RB2 range for the Monday Night Football tilt against an Eagles team that gave up 281 rushing yards to the Bears in their previous contest.</description>

      <title>Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that the Jets are signing CB Jordan Clark to the active roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-f4d9-da9b-a9bf-fedd4b800000</link>
      <description>Clark has been on the practice squad, but with Jarvis Brownlee Jr. out with a hip injury, the Jets could turn to the 24-year-old as a potential nickel option for Week 14 against the Dolphins.</description>
