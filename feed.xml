      <title>49ers ruled out WR Ricky Pearsall (knee) for Week 7 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f3fc-da18-a39b-fbff82ce0000</link>
      <description>We do not yet know if Pearsall returned to practice on Friday, but we suspect he remains sidelined. The 49ers will be without their talented boundary wide receiver for the third straight week. Pearsall sprained his PCL in Week 4, but was looking like a weekly WR2 before that. Hopefully, he can return for the 49ers’ away game against the Texans in Week 8.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (ankle/ribs/shoulder) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 7 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f409-d99b-a1dd-fe0df3b40000</link>
      <description>Jennings is very difficult to trust after last week’s meltdown. He was limited twice to begin the week, and we do not yet know his Friday participation level. At this point, the big-bodied wide receiver can only be viewed as a boom-bust WR4/FLEX option. If and when he resumes practicing in full consistently, we will be able to upgrade him to WR3 status. 49ers rookie WR Jordan Watkins (calf) is also expected to play this weekend.</description>

      <title>Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee) is doubtful to play in Week 7 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f410-d99b-a1dd-fe1c7ad60000</link>
      <description>Bowers returned to practice on Friday, practicing in a limited capacity. All signs point toward Bowers sitting out in Week 7, though with head coach Pete Carroll, anything is possible. If Bowers is active, he has decent odds of finishing as a mid-to-low TE1, though he would, of course, be at risk of re-injury and is unlikely to produce a ceiling game.</description>

      <title>Raiders WR Jakobi Meyers (knee/toe) is questionable to play in Week 7 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f409-da18-a39b-fe1b6aea0000</link>
      <description>Meyers practiced just once this week, participating in a limited capacity on Friday. He should be truly questionable to suit up this week, which means fantasy managers must closely monitor reports on Saturday and Sunday, if they plan to start him. He has a tough matchup if he is active, though his target volume could help him deliver FLEX results with TE Brock Bowers (knee) doubtful to play.</description>

      <title>Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said he feels “good” about WR Darnell Mooney (hamstring) playing in Week 7 against the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f419-df81-ab9b-fedfa2ee0000</link>
      <description>Frankly, this is a little surprising. Mooney began the week with two limited practices before sitting out on Friday. Perhaps it was a scheduled day off as Mooney attempts to return from a hamstring strain suffered in Week 4. Despite Morris’ good vibes, the team lists Mooney as questionable to play on the official injury report. If he is active, he can be treated as a boom-bust FLEX option.</description>

      <title>Packers RB Josh Jacobs (illness/calf) is questionable to play in Week 7 against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f413-d99b-a1dd-fe1f6e6b0000</link>
      <description>Jacobs was listed with an illness on Wednesday and Thursday, before having the calf designation added sometime late on Friday. For what it is worth, he did manage to practice in full today, so this could be a non-issue. Fantasy managers should closely monitor news on the matter this weekend, though. Packers RBs Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks are next in line if Jacobs cannot play. Wilson has out-touched Brooks 22-7 this season.</description>

      <title>Broncos released QB Sam Ehlinger.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f429-da18-a39b-fe3b95490000</link>
      <description>Ehlinger was released from the team before being re-signed to the practice squad back in August, and later promoted to the active roster. He is expected to be re-signed to the practice squad again shortly, though he is free to pursue employment elsewhere. The Broncos recently activated LB Dre Greenlaw (quad) from injured reserve. Ehlinger’s release was likely done to create space for him.</description>

      <title>Panthers TE Ja’Tavion Sanders (ankle) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 7 against the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f42c-d99b-a1dd-fe2caf2b0000</link>
      <description>Sanders has been sidelined by his sprained ankle since injuring it in Week 3. The 22-year-old tight end will be difficult to trust in his first game back and can only be treated as a TE2. The Panthers are also getting back slot receiver Jalen Coker (quad), and Sanders will likely operate behind him in the target pecking order.</description>

      <title>Seahawks CB Devon Witherspoon (knee) practiced in full on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f483-d651-a9df-fd9721130000</link>
      <description>Witherspoon was a limited participant on Thursday. That is the good news. The bad news is that CB Riq Woolen (concussion) was downgraded from full participation on Thursday to a limited session on Friday. That suggests Woolen’s prior concussion symptoms may have recurred. Seahawks S Julian Love (hamstring) remains limited and LB Derick Hall (oblique) remains sidelined.</description>

      <title>Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak said he wants to give RB Kenneth Walker III “more opportunities” but does not want to “discount” RB Zach Charbonnet and RB George Holani.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-f4ab-df81-ab9b-feefbf770000</link>
      <description>Kubiak also celebrated Walker’s improvement “as a practice player,” and for being “very intentional about the things we’re asking him to work on.” Kubiak’s initial statement leaves room for interpretation as to whether the team actually intends to increase Walker’s workload, though. Just yesterday, The Athletic’sMike Dugarasked head coach Mike Macdonald about whether Walker had earned more work with his per-play efficiency, to which Macdonald said the team takes stats “into account,” but that they “have a plan for their RB usage.” Referring to Walker and Charbonnet, Macdonald added that both players are playing “high-level football” and that they will both keep being used. Until we see Walker significantly out-touch Charbonnet, we can only treat Kubiak’s comments as wishful thinking.</description>
