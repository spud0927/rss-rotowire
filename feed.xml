      <title>Broncos signed QB Sam Ehlinger to the active roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0e2b-d5d8-a3ff-ff6bc0a50000</link>
      <description>Ehlinger has bounced between the active roster and practice squad for the Broncos to start the season. He was briefly released and brought back to the practice squad last week and is now back on the active roster. Ehlinger will continue to sit behind Bo Nix and Jarrett Stidham amidst the Broncos’ roster management ping-ponging his roster status.</description>

      <title>Texans TE Dalton Schultz (back/shoulder) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0e32-d5d8-a3ff-ff73536c0000</link>
      <description>Schultz lands on the injury report with back and shoulder issues to begin the week. The 29-year-old caught nine of his 10 targets as one of C.J. Stroud’s top pass-catchers in Week 7. With a limited practice, he is still trending to play in Week 8 against the 49ers and should get a boost with Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring) dealing with injuries.</description>

      <title>Packers WR Christian Watson said, “my plan is to play” in Week 8 against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0e44-dab4-a3fb-9f7496710000</link>
      <description>Watson is ramping up from a torn ACL 10 months ago and this is his final week to be activated from his 21-day activation window. The 26-year-old is confident he will play against the Steelers, adding another wrinkle to the Packers offense. Doubs is Jordan Love’s current No. 1, but Watson is in line to take some of those deep targets away from Doubs and rookie Matthew Golden. He is worth a stash on fantasy benches as his production ramps up moving forward.</description>

      <title>Giants designated K Graham Gano (groin) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-0e77-d5d8-a3ff-ff77a0630000</link>
      <description>Gano initially went on injured reserve last month with a groin issue. Jude McAtamney took over for him, but was waived this week after multiple missed extra points in Week 7. Gano is nearing a return to kick for the Giants, but Younghoe Koo awaits on the practice squad if he is not ready for Week 8.</description>

      <title>Chargers LT Joe Alt (ankle) said he plans to play in Week 8 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-111d-d5d8-a3ff-f97d4cdc0000</link>
      <description>Alt is listed as questionable and could still be held out of tonight’s game, but it looks like he is back after missing under a month with a high-ankle sprain. Alt went down with the injury in Week 4. Fellow LA offensive Trey Pipkins is also listed as questionable. Getting both blockers back would be a huge boost to a Chargers squad that is 1-4 over its past five games.</description>

      <title>Dolphins restructured LB Jordyn Brooks’ contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1122-d245-adfb-957f09a30000</link>
      <description>Per ESPN’s Field Yates, the move clears up $3 million in cap space. For most teams, contract maneuvers at this point in the season would cause some speculation that they are looking to add at the trade deadline. For the Dolphins, the extra cap space would allow them to absorb some dead cap from outgoing contracts. Jaylen Waddle is the biggest name that could be on the move, but Miami also has multiple pass-rushers who will be of interest to contending teams.</description>

      <title>Packers coach Matt LaFleur said WR Dontayvion Wicks (calf) is unlikely to play in Week 8 against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-11a3-d245-adfb-95ff5ac00000</link>
      <description>Christian Watson has a chance to return this week, but LaFleur noted that the decision will ultimately come down to the medical staff. Watson is working his way back from the torn ACL he suffered late in the 2024 season. Wicks is dealing with a calf injury that forced him to miss Wednesday’s practice. We’ll assume it’s another DNP for him today. If Watson is back, he could step into a full-time role right away. Savion Williams and Malik Heath would see more work if both wideouts are sidelined for Week 8.</description>

      <title>Garrett Wilson (knee) was not seen at Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-11e9-deb1-a39b-31efa4bc0000</link>
      <description>Wilson was held out of Wednesday’s practice and looks like a DNP again today. He is a long-shot to suit up on Sunday. With a Week 9 bye up next, Wilson should be back on the field in Week 10 versus the Browns. Until then, Tyler Johnson and Josh Reynolds will operate as the team’s top wideouts. Neither player is awfully appealing for fantasy purposes.</description>

      <title>Kareem Hunt (knee) did not practice Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-11fb-d245-adfb-95fff9a90000</link>
      <description>Hunt suffered a bone bruise in his knee in Week 7 against the Raiders. He logged a season-low four carries and was held without a reception for the first time this year. Now he looks unlikely to suit up on Monday versus the Commanders. If Hunt is unable to play, Isiah Pacheco will finally get the chance to dominate the backfield carries, with Brashard Smith also pitching in for more touches than usual.</description>

      <title>Chiefs RG Trey Smith (back) did not practice Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1200-dab4-a3fb-9b7077fb0000</link>
      <description>Smith is dealing with back spasms. Head coach Andy Reid expressed some optimism that he will be able to suit up for Monday’s game versus the Commanders. Left tackle Josh Simmons remains out for personal reasons. Simmons isn’t expected to play this week.</description>
