      <title>Steelers CB Joey Porter Jr. (hamstring) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3aaf-da67-a99f-feff89f90000</link>
      <description>A second missed practice puts Porter on the wrong side of questionable. Fortunately, the Steelers still have Jalen Ramsey and Darius Slay. The Steelers face the Seahawks this week, whose only aerial threat in Week 1 was Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Cooper Kupp was a complete non-factor.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (shoulder) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3aba-da67-a99f-feff34920000</link>
      <description>Jennings is now on the wrong side of questionable. He will need to practice in some capacity tomorrow if he is to suit up for Week 2 against the Saints. Perhaps, the only redeeming aspect of the 49ers’ brutal week is that their opponent is about as soft as one can hope for. Ricky Pearsall and Christian McCaffrey will be leaned upon in this one.</description>

      <title>Giants claimed WR/KR Xavier Gipson, formerly of the Jets.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3ac1-d294-a19b-fef1f7820000</link>
      <description>Gipson signed with the Jets as a 2023 undrafted free agent, catching 27-of-46 targets for 268 yards and one touchdown in his time there. He’s averaged 26.0 yards per kickoff return on 44 career returns and 8.9 yards per punt return on 68 punt returns. He is likely to contribute on special teams again with the Giants.</description>

      <title>Lions LT Taylor Decker (shoulder) is expected to play in Week 2 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3ae7-d294-a19b-fef7c0920000</link>
      <description>Decker underwent offseason shoulder surgery and missed time in training camp as a result. He played all 67 offensive snaps in Week 1 but “a problem with his shoulder caused” him to miss practice on both Wednesday and Thursday this week. Lions OC John Morton commented on the matter succinctly, saying, “we’re totally expecting Decker to play.” Decker’s availability does not appear to be jeopardized, but Detroit’s blindside protector is ailing. Stay tuned.</description>

      <title>Packers DL Micah Parsons (back) is active for Week 2 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3aed-d86f-abdd-7ffdd7bb0000</link>
      <description>The Packers’ vaunted defense will have its new star pass rusher on the field. Unfortunately, the Packers declared CB Bo Melton, S Zayne Anderson, RT Zach Tom (oblique), LG Aaron Banks (ankle/groin), TE Ben Sims and DL Warren Brinson inactive. Losing both Tom and Banks hurts Jordan Love’s protection. It would be unsurprising to see the Packers dial up quick-hitting pass plays to help reduce pressure from Washington’s pass rush. On the plus side, Packers CB Nate Hobbs (knee) is active.</description>

      <title>Commanders RB Chris Rodriguez is inactive for Week 2 against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3aff-dc44-a9d9-3ffffa740000</link>
      <description>Rodriguez’s absence once again clears the way for rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt to lead the Commanders’ rushing attack. Austin Ekeler led the backfield with 33 offensive snaps last week, though, and is the favorite to do so again, operating in his typical receiving-heavy role. The Commanders also declared P Mitch Wishnowsky, QB Josh Johnson, LB Ale Kaho, LB Kain Medrano, T Trent Scott and T George Fant inactive.</description>

      <title>Bears RB Roschon Johnson (foot) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3aed-d86f-abdd-7ffdcae30000</link>
      <description>Johnson is being eased into action following a lengthy rehab program. Initially, his limited session on Wednesday seemed to indicate that he was on track to debut in Week 2. His continued limitations put him firmly in the questionable camp. Earlier this week, Bears head coach Ben Johnson said he wanted to get RB Kyle Monangai more involved as a rusher. Johnson could find himself in the No. 3 role, if Johnson’s plan comes to fruition and Monangai seizes the moment.</description>

      <title>Bears CB Jaylon Johnson (calf/groin) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3b0f-d86f-abdd-7fbf5e670000</link>
      <description>Bears slot CB Kyler Gordon (hamstring), unfortunately, remains sidelined. Johnson should be good to go for Week 2 against the Lions at this point. We should find out soon if Johnson is truly back to full health when he is asked to cover Detroit speedster Jameson Williams. Gordon’s likely absence is significant for Lions slot receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown.</description>

      <title>Seahawks CB Devon Witherspoon (knee) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3b23-d86f-abdd-7fbf80600000</link>
      <description>Seahawks S Julian Love (groin) was also downgraded to a non-participant after practicing in a limited capacity on Wednesday. Fellow Seahawks S Nick Emmanwori (ankle) was recently placed on injured reserve. With the secondary in such rough shape, the Seahawks signed CB Shaquill Griffin from the practice squad. The team correspondingly released WR Cody White before immediately signing him to the practice squad.</description>

      <title>Rams OL Rob Havenstein (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-3b29-d86f-abdd-7fbd948b0000</link>
      <description>Havenstein sat out Wednesday’s practice, so his return is a great sign. The Rams also got back OL Kevin Dotson (ankle), who likewise practiced in a limited capacity. Fellow OL Steve Avila (ankle) remained sidelined. The Rams’ offensive line is banged up, but the unit is at least on the upswing, which bodes positively for Matthew Stafford’s ability to stay upright against the Titans in Week 2.</description>
