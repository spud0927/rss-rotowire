      <title>Browns downgraded QB Shedeur Sanders (back) to questionable for Week 8 against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1d34-d245-adfb-9d7f041a0000</link>
      <description>The team elevated Bailey Zappe from the practice squad in an associated move, making it likely Sanders is forced to miss Week 8 against the Patriots. Sanders continues to push for playing time behind Dillon Gabriel, although it appears as if his bid for the starting quarterback gig will be on hold for a week.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Eagles are not expected to trade A.J. Brown.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-206c-dab4-a3fb-bb7c48bd0000</link>
      <description>Cryptic posts and quiet box scores have fueled rumors that the Eagles could look to move Brown at the trade deadline this year. Even Schefter notes that the Eagles “would be willing to listen to any trade offer.” However, they will need a blockbuster proposal to move their star wideout, and Schefter doesn’t see that happening. Even if the Eagles aren’t going to open up their passing game every week, Brown is worth more to them as a Super Bowl contender than most other teams. He was also starting to turn things around before suffering a hamstring injury that has already ruled him out for Week 8. Brown had 121 yards and two scores in Week 7 and hit 80 yards on six grabs in Week 6. As fun as imagining trade scenarios for Brown might be, there is almost no universe in which he gets moved.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Breece Hall (knee) is expected to play in Week 8 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-2072-dab4-a3fb-bb72883b0000</link>
      <description>Tight end Mason Taylor is also expected to play. Jets head coach Aaron Glenn said on Friday that Hall was trending in the right direction. He got in two limited practices to start the week and was upgraded to a full session on Friday. Expect a heavy commitment to the ground game from Glenn this week as he tries to hide Justin Fields, who he was forced to start because of Tyrod Taylor’s knee injury. Hall, per usual, is a volume-based RB1 with big-play upside.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Mason Taylor (quad) is expected to play in Week 8 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-207b-dab4-a3fb-bb7b8a580000</link>
      <description>The Jets have ruled out Garrett Wilson and placed Josh Reynolds on injured reserve over the weekend. Taylor and Tyler Johnson will be Justin Fields’ top wideouts for Week 8. Though we don’t expect much passing output from the Jets this week, Taylor will play a de facto WR1 role for his team because of the injuries. That alone puts him in the streaming mix for Week 8.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Kirk Cousins will start in Week 8 against the Dolphins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-207f-deb1-a39b-217f35370000</link>
      <description>Schefter called it official, though the team has not actually made an announcement yet. It’s good enough for us. Michael Penix is dealing with a bone bruise in his knee. He was listed as questionable after three limited practices this week. Penix played through the issue in Week 7 but wasn’t able to recover in time for the Falcons’ date with Miami. It’s a great matchup for Cousins’ first start of the year. He should be able to post strong efficiency numbers, even if the Falcons largely attack the Dolphins on the ground. Cousins will crack the QB2 ranks n a week loaded with byes and quarterback injuries.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “league sources believe Rashid Shaheed can be had for the right price.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-2084-d5d8-a3ff-f9e557330000</link>
      <description>Schefter notes that the Saints are attempting to sign Chris Olave to a contract extension. He has one year left on his rookie deal and the Saints aren’t likely to let him see free agency. Shaheed, on the other hand, is 27 years old and an impending free agent, making him a prime candidate for a rebuilding Saints to move at the trade deadline. Schefter mentioned the Steelers, Broncos, and Bills as teams aggressively pursuing wide receivers via trade. Schefter also mentioned Brandin Cooks as a trade candidate, though it’s hard to imagine much of a market for his services at this point in his career.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports D’Andre Swift (groin) is expected to play in Week 8 against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-2089-deb1-a39b-218ff9140000</link>
      <description>Swift was listed as questionable after a week of limited practices. He did the same thing last week and had no issues suiting up come game time. Swift wound up running for 124 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. Facing a Ravens team without Lamar Jackson, the Bears are now favored, creating the potential for positive game script for both Swift and Kyle Monangai. Swift remains a staple of the RB2 ranks for Week 8.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports the Jaguars are “listening on calls” for Brian Thomas Jr.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-208e-d5d8-a3ff-f9ef4b850000</link>
      <description>Russini herself notes that a trade for the second-year wideout is “highly unlikely.” Still, it’s notable that the Jags are even picking up the phone. Coming off 1,282 receiving yards as a rookie, expectations were sky high for BTJ entering his second season. The results, however, have been underwhelming. He is on pace for 886 receiving yards on just 66 receptions. Thomas Jr. has also been playing through multiple injuries, seemingly leading him to avoid contact at the catch point, resulting in several uncharacterstic drops. While things haven’t gone his way this year, we don’t expet the Jaguars to abandon ship anytime soon. Barring an offer they can’t refuse, the Jags will be keeping BTJ through the trade deadline.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reports “the hope is that” A.J. Brown (hamstring) will play in Week 10 against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-20af-d245-adfb-b5ff5cd50000</link>
      <description>Brown is out for Week 8 after missing all three practices. The Eagles get their bye next week, giving Brown an extra week of rest before he attempts to return for a showdown with Green Bay that will have massive playoff implications. Garafolo also shut down any notions of a trade for Brown. Despite the rumor mill operating at max capacity in regards to Brown, the Eagles aren’t trading their superstar wideout in the midst of another season with Super Bowl aspirations.</description>

      <title>Tua Tagovailoa (illness) was added to the injury report but will play in Week 8 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-20be-deb1-a39b-21be50e10000</link>
      <description>The Dolphins are just doing their due diligence with injury reporting by making note of the illness. Or they are giving themselves an alibi for when they pull Tagovailoa for Quinn Ewers at halftime. Who’s to say? In all seriousness, this shouldn’t affect Tua as the Dolphins prepare to take on Atlanta, eying just their second win of the season. Tua has had his moments this year with four multi-score games, but the lows have been lower than ever. Tagovailoa leads the league with 10 interceptions. The illness won’t prevent him from finishing Week 8, but his play might.</description>
