      <title>Bears coach Ben Johnson said DJ Moore (groin) is “day by day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e4a4-d94a-a79d-edad05f20000</link>
      <description>Moore was transported to a hospital following the game, per a statement released by the Bears. He played 60 of 64 offensive snaps in the game, per PFF. Marquee noted that Moore did show a “slight hobble” at some point in the first quarter after being hit on his lower left side. This will be something to watch out for on Wednesday’s injury report. Moore being down would seem to give Luther Burden a chance to shine in Week 7.</description>

      <title>Chargers released EDGE Clelin Ferrell.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e4bf-db72-a199-feff11b30000</link>
      <description>Ferrell was the fourth pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, but he’s come nowhere close to living up to those expectations and served in a reserve role for the Commanders and 49ers over the past two seasons. The 28-year-old defender is released to make room for Jaret Patterson, who was signed to the practice squad in a corresponding transaction.</description>

      <title>Cowboys waived WR Jalen Cropper.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e4c7-d94a-a79d-edcfe9cf0000</link>
      <description>Cropper, 24, has only played eight offensive snaps, but has been a contributor to the special teams unit. It wouldn’t be a massive surprise if he rejoined Dallas on the practice squad if/when he goes unclaimed.</description>

      <title>Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports that the Colts are signing Brett Rypien to the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e4d8-db72-a199-fedb29190000</link>
      <description>The Colts worked out several quarterbacks in the wake of the injury to Anthony Richardson, but it appears Rypien has won that spot. He’ll likely be the third quarterback behind Daniel Jones and Riley Leonard with Richardson on injured reserve due to his orbital fracture.</description>

      <title>Lions head coach Dan Campbell said DL Alim McNeill (knee) is expected to play in Week 7 against the Bucs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e7cd-d94a-a79d-efcd7bde0000</link>
      <description>Barring a setback in the next few days, McNeill should be able to return to game against against Tampa, Campbell said Wednesday. McNeill, who missed two games with a knee injury, would be a welcome addition to a Detroit defense that has struggled of late. His return would be a slight downgrade for Rachaad White as the Bucs’ lead rusher.</description>

      <title>David Njoku (knee) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e857-dd4c-afb9-efd789020000</link>
      <description>Njoku would appear to be a long shot to suit up this week against the Dolphins. He left Week 6’s loss to the Steelers with the knee issue, and head coach Kevin Stefanski on Monday did not provide an update on his status. Harold Fannin would likely see an increase in routes and targets if Njoku is sidelined against Miami. The Browns have targeted the tight end position at a 33 percent rate this season, the second highest mark in the NFL. Fannin in Week 6 had seven receptions for 81 yards on ten targets. He’s an intriguing fantasy option against a Dolphins defense allowing 7.5 targets per game to opposing tight ends.</description>

      <title>Bengals palced TE Mike Gesicki (pec) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e85f-dd4c-afb9-efdf07e40000</link>
      <description>Gesicki will miss at least four games after sustaining a knee injury last week against the Packers. Noah Fant and Tanner HUdson split tight end routes after Gesicki exited the game; Hudson saw five targets while Fant saw four from Joe Flacco. Fant would be the slight favorite to be the team’s nominal TE1 going forward, as he’s been targeted on a strong 30 percent of his pass routes in 2025.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter said Browns QB Deshaun Watson (Achilles) is “a good month away from being cleared for any football activity.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e870-db72-a199-fa7b5e310000</link>
      <description>That doesn’t mean, of course, that Watson will be ready to step in and start games for the Browns in December. But being cleared for football activities means he’s inching closer to a return after tearing his Achilles tendon twice over the past year. Watson, 30, has 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions for the Browns over his three seasons with the team. It would be something of a surprise if the Browns gave him a start in the final month of the regular season. Dillon Gabriel remains the team’s starter for now.</description>

      <title>Colts head coach Shane Steichen said there’s no timetable for Anthony Richardson (eye) to return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e881-def2-abdb-fde112b80000</link>
      <description>Richardson suffered a serious eye injury before the Colts’ Week 6 game against the Cardinals when an elastic workout band snapped and broke his orbital bone. The team placed Richardson on injured reserve, meaning he’ll miss at least one month. Steichen’s comments point to that absence being longer, however. Richardson, a former first-round draft pick, may have played his final game as a Colt.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Rashee Rice will have a “heavy workload” in Week 7 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e895-dd4c-afb9-efd5bf5c0000</link>
      <description>The Chiefs have no plans to ease Rice back into the starting lineup after he was suspended for the season’s first six games. Rice, according to Fowler, “has been in the building for weeks, had an excellent training camp and is in peak physical shape. A team source says Rice will be ‘full bore’ this week as he gets back onto the practice field.” It sound like fantasy managers can expect something close to a full route share and Rice’s normal role as a dominator of intermediate targets from Patrick Mahomes against a vulnerable Vegas secondary. Rice’s return will likely hurt Travis Kelce’s targets as he loses out on those intermediate looks.</description>
