      <title>Panthers coach Dave Canales said Tetairoa McMillan (hamstring) might not play on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bea6-d90d-a5bd-beff95bd0000</link>
      <description>McMillan did not practice today and it is regarded as a “minor” hamstring ailment, but it would make no sense for the Panthers to risk his health in the third week of the preseason anyway. We have no concerns about McMillan’s status for Week 1 at this point. The volume he’s set to command in what could be an improved Carolina passing attack should make him a viable WR3 in his rookie season, at the very least.</description>

      <title>Panthers coach Dave Canales said Andy Dalton (elbow) is dealing with a “muscle issue” and “could play if this was the regular season.”</title>

      <description>Sounds like Bryce Perkins was just signed to sop up some reps on Thursday ahead of cutdowns with Dalton and Bryce Young unlikely to play. Dalton should carry on as Young’s backup again in 2025 assuming Canales’ forecast for his injury holds.</description>

      <title>Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel said De’Von Achane (calf) is unlikely to practice this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bea9-d05a-adda-beabdee90000</link>
      <description>It’s important to note that McDaniel said the decision to keep Achane out of practice this week is “preventative in nature,” which seemingly downplays the severity of this injury. Achane was reported last week to have suffered a “soft tissue lower-body injury” that would keep him out between “days and weeks,” but it doesn’t sound like he’ll be at risk of missing Week 1 based on McDaniel’s update. We’ll have to revisit this the next time McDaniel provides an update on his RB1’s availability.</description>

      <title>Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel said there’s a chance Darren Waller could return to practice this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-beab-d90d-a5bd-befb18730000</link>
      <description>McDaniel said 12 days ago that Waller was a week away from practicing, so we won’t expect too much here. The veteran tight end came out of retirement to join the Dolphins in late July and was reported to be in “tremendous shape,” but his camp-long absence suggests there’s some work to do to get him ready for the season. Waller’s fantasy outlook is tough to predict, but there’s little reason to think he’ll be more than a league-average tight end at this point in his career.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Matt Barrows believes that “if [Christian McCaffrey] is not back to his 2023 form, he’s pretty close to it.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-beb1-d45c-a7fc-bebb4d780000</link>
      <description>With a lot of uncertainty in the wideout corps due to injuries, Barrows expects the 49ers “will lean on” McCaffrey and George Kittle early in the passing game. That is music to the ears of fantasy managers. McCaffrey being in tip-top shape is also huge news — though we’re sure we’ll see plenty of him on the injury report as always this year. The fact that he objectively looks close to 2023 form after a short 2024 comeback where he didn’t appear to be himself is great news.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Chad Graff believes Patriots S Kyle Dugger “may not make the team.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bec4-df63-a199-ffef08a50000</link>
      <description>Dugger was playing deep into the fourth quarter with third-stringers in New England’s second preseason game, and he finished 2024 with a ghastly 34.8 PFF coverage grade — by far the worst of his five-year career. The Patriots wouldn’t get much cap relief from releasing Duggar, who is making $14.5 million a season, but Graff believes “they might do it anyway.”</description>

      <title>Chiefs placed DE Felix Anudike-Uzomah (hamstring) on injured reserve, ending his season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bed8-d90d-a5bd-bedb0eb30000</link>
      <description>Anudike-Uzomah was a first-round pick of the Chiefs back in 2023 and has totaled three career sacks in the 34 games he’s appeared in this season. He has yet to live up to the hype that made him a top pick and will now hope to rebound in 2026 in what will be a contract year.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bed8-d90d-a5bd-bedb0eb30000</guid>

      <title>Ravens HC John Harbaugh said DeAndre Hopkins is “working on his knee a little bit” when asked about an injury update.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bee8-d90d-a5bd-befbae9d0000</link>
      <description>It’s not much of an update, but Harbaugh also didn’t sound like a coach overly concerned about Hopkins’ Week 1 availability. Hopkins’ knee injury was first reported on July 24, but the veteran receiver has still participated in some practices since then. We’ll assume that Monday’s absence isn’t much more than a management day until the team gives us reason to fear otherwise.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports “there’s an increasing feeling that the Browns will carry four QBs on their 53-man roster.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bef2-d05a-adda-bef2b8df0000</link>
      <description>The Browns’ decision to keep four quarterbacks on the roster has felt like a possibility ever since they drafted Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round, following his unprecedented fall. Both Sanders and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel have always been near locks to make the roster, and with Joe Flacco the unquestioned QB1, the only decision to really be made was whether or not to retain Kenny Pickett. The Browns’ quarterback room isn’t great. At best, it’s a room full of question marks that may or may not have a franchise quarterback in the waiting, such as Gabriel or Sanders, but that’s still to be determined. Rostering four quarterbacks in hopes of getting a look at the younger guys later in the season feels like the most logical move for a team that has plenty of questions to answer at the position this season and beyond.</description>

      <title>Dolphins signed EDGE Matthew Judon, formerly of the Falcons, to a one-year contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-bf00-d45c-a7fc-bf1a46820000</link>
      <description>NFL insider Jordan Schultz was the first to report the actual signing. Judon will head to the Fins to serve in what will likely be a situational pass-rush role. During three seasons with the Patriots, Judon totaled 32 sacks in 38 games, but managed just 5.5 sacks in 17 games with the Falcons last season. Set to enter his age-33 year, it’s fair to assume his best years are behind him, but Judon should still have enough in the tank to offer a defense in a lighter-used role.</description>
