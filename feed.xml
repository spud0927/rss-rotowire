      <title>Amon-Ra St. Brown caught 2-of-12 targets for 42 yards in the Lions’ Week 11 loss to the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9035-d713-ad9e-fc755f8a0000</link>
      <description>St. Brown was held without a catch in the second half as quarterback Jared Goff completed just two of his final 18 pass attempts. The Lions were also stopped on five fourth down attempts as they struggled through unrelenting pressure and lockdown coverage against an Eagles defense that has now allowed just 16 points to the Packers and Lions their last two games. St. Brown will look to return to fantasy stardom his next time out when the Lions host the Giants in Week 12.</description>

      <title>Dontayvion Wicks caught 1-of-2 targets for nine yards in the Packers’ Week 11 win over the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9038-d45b-affe-d5be33ed0000</link>
      <description>Wicks ran ahead of a returning Matthew Golden (shoulder) but caught the same amount of passes and drew one fewer target. Even as Romeo Doubs dropped everything in sight, the Pack never seemed to consider getting Wicks more involved. Although he is only 24 years old, it is getting late early on Wicks’ dynasty league career. He has no current demonstrated path to 2025 re-draft appeal.</description>

      <title>Savion Williams caught a 33-yard pass in the Packers’ Week 11 win over the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-903a-d673-a39e-b4bbb8780000</link>
      <description>The third-round rookie’s lone reception was his fourth quarter grab which came against extremely tight coverage on 3rd-and-10. It was a highlight-reel level play, and the longest reception of his young career. Williams is playing extremely few snaps even as the Packers hunt for playmakers, but the rare times he’s on the field, he seems to command targets. Six days shy of his 24th birthday, Williams’ advanced age limits his long-term dynasty appeal, but he remains worth an end-of-bench spot.</description>

      <title>Jalen Hurts completed 14-of-28 passes for 135 yards in the Eagles’ 16-9, Week 11 win over the Lions, adding 31 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9038-d673-a39e-b4b9410d0000</link>
      <description>Hurts continues to average the lowest yards per carry of his standout career, still sitting below the 3.7 yards per carry he averaged against the Lions. Much of that can be attributed to being stopped on four tush push attempts on consecutive drives in the fourth quarter after scoring on the same play earlier in the game, the last of which gave the Lions the ball already in field goal position while down 10 with just over two minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. That also marks consecutive games in which head coach Nick Sirianni’s end-game play calling anc lock management came into question. Even so, a retooled defense at the trade deadline has ceded just 16 combined points to the Packers and Lions in their previous two games, something that continues to mask an underperforming offense. Hurts and the rest of the offense seemed to cater to the squeaky wheel in this one, feeding A.J. Brown 11 targets on only 28 pass attempts. The Eagles improve to 8-2 with the win ahead of a meeting with the division rival Cowboys in Week 12.</description>

      <title>Saquon Barkley rushed 26 times for 83 yards in the Eagles’ Week 11 win over the Lions, adding seven yards on one reception.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-903e-d713-ad9e-fc7ee0ae0000</link>
      <description>Barkley struggled to get the wheels turning in the first half but made multiple nice runs in the fourth quarter to help the Eagles put the game away, coming close to ripping off chunk gains on multiple occasions in the final frame. Even so, fantasy managers that sunk a first round pick into the veteran are assuredly left wanting more as Barkley now has only two carries of 20 or more yards after amassing 17 such carries during his historic 2024 season. Of note, the Eagles lost center Cam Jurgens and offensive tackle Lane Johnson to aggravated injuries in this one, which is something to keep an eye on ahead of a Week 12 matchup with the Cowboys.</description>

      <title>A.J. Brown caught 7-of-11 targets for 49 yards in the Eagles’ Week 11 win over the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9042-d713-ad9e-fc5656b60000</link>
      <description>Brown saw just two downfield targets while primarily working the short areas with slants and outs, an interesting approach considering the Lions were once again down multiple starters in the secondary. The increased targets appear to be more than coincidence after Brown was seen telling fantasy managers to drop him on a livestream of him playing Madden earlier in the week. The outspoken receiver is averaging the lowest yards per game of his standout career, and yet, the Eagles currently sit at an 8-2 record and in the driver’s seat for the only bye out of the NFC.</description>

      <title>Dallas Goedert caught 2-of-5 targets for 24 yards in the Eagles’ Week 11 win over the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9046-d673-a39e-b4d71b7b0000</link>
      <description>That now makes seven of nine appearances in which Goedert has managed four receptions or fewer while playing for a seemingly dysfunctional offense now ranked 16th in points per game. Goedert derives the bulk of his fantasy value from an elite red zone role, meaning his weekly range of outcomes remains one of the widest at the position, of current TE1s. That doesn’t change ahead of a divisional tilt against the Cowboys in Week 12.</description>

      <title>DeVonta Smith caught 1-of-5 targets for eight yards in the Eagles’ Week 11 win over the Lions.</title>

      <description>Smith doesn’t get a complete pass as he dropped his first target on the first play from scrimmage, but it is noteworthy that quarterback Jalen Hurts peppered A.J. Brown with 11 targets after the outspoken wide receiver was seen telling fantasy managers to drop him on a livestream of him playing Madden earlier in the week. The explosive receiver will look to get back on track in Week 12 when the Eagles face off against the porous defense of the Cowboys.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Aaron Rodgers (fractured wrist) will undergo tests to determine whether or not he can play in Week 12 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9204-d713-ad9e-fe54693b0000</link>
      <description>Rodgers is dealing with a fracture in his left wrist, but according to Rapoport, whether or not Rodgers plays in Week 12 will be dependent on whether or not he can further injure himself and whether or not he can grip a football. The injury is to Rodgers’ non-throwing hand/wrist, which is good in theory, but there are obviously times he will need that hand to secure the ball and keep it away from a defender when pressured in the pocket. Rapoport said Rodgers “was described as 50-50" for next week, so we’ll see where things go from here in the coming days. If he’s unable to go, Mason Rudolph would draw his first start of the season.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports the league will review the spitting incident that took place between Ja’Marr Chase and Jalen Ramsey in Week 11.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-920e-d673-a39e-b69fe8500000</link>
      <description>When asked why he punched Chase in Week 11’s win over the Bengals, Steelers corner Ramsey accused Chase of spitting on him, which the star receiver denied. Videos have since surfaced showing Chase clearly spitting in the direction of Ramsey, but whether or not there was any intent to spit on Ramsey is up for interpretation. The league will presumably look to determine whether or not Chase intended to spit on Ramsey during their review of the matter, but it’s possible that a one-game suspension could be handed down, similar to what we saw with Jalen Carter in Week 1 when he spat on Dak Prescott after the opening kickoff.</description>
