      <title>Chiefs HC Andy Reid said “there’s nothing happening there” when asked if the team has had any talks with Tyreek Hill.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7c4d-d629-a1bc-fc5d120e0000</link>
      <description>We’re just days removed from Hill being released by the Dolphins. Furthermore, Reid adds that he doesn’t know if Hill “is healthy right now to do anything.” While Reid didn’t rule out the possibility of a reunion with the veteran receiver, it isn’t all too surprising to hear that the two sides have yet to discuss things. Hill has already said he intends to play in 2026 when he is healthy, but with his availability for training camp already in doubt, Hill may have to prove to teams he is able to play before signing a deal.</description>

      <title>Chiefs HC Andy Reid said he underwent a minor knee procedure and will not be available for the interviews at next week’s NFL Combine.</title>

      <description>Reid doesn’t expect to be out of commission for long, but it is notable that he will be unable to meet with prospects next week when so many other teams are gathering intel and speaking with the incoming class. The Chiefs hold the ninth overall pick in this year’s draft and have several positions they could consider addressing given their concerns with the wide receiver room, and a backfield that also needs to be overhauled.</description>

      <title>Chiefs HC Andy Reid said “there is communication” with Travis Kelce.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7c54-d042-afbc-7dd6761d0000</link>
      <description>Reid added that he believes communication is “the main thing” and that he thinks Kelce wants “to move forward.” Reid declined to say whether Kelce gave him a definite answer on whether he wants to return to the Chiefs in 2026, but it sounds like things are trending in that direction. Kelce, 36, has mulled retirement over the last few offseasons, but the prevailing belief of those close to him is that he will return for at least one more season. Kelce caught 76 passes for 851 yards and five touchdowns last season while averaging 11.2 YPR, his highest yards per reception total since 2022.</description>

      <title>Bills signed OL Alec Anderson to a one-year, $3 million extension through 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7c9d-d629-a1bc-fc9d07be0000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport notes that Anderson played in every Bills game last year, notching six starts over the last two seasons. Anderson grades out surprisingly well as a run-blocker, earning a 76.2 PFF run-blocking grade via 237 qualifying snaps in 2024 and an 82.8 PFF run-blocking grade via 129 run-blocking snaps in 2025.</description>

      <title>Chargers hired Max McCaffrey as their new running backs coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7c71-d629-a1bc-fc7d87b90000</link>
      <description>McCaffrey is a former undrafted free agent NFL wide receiver who spent time with five different NFL teams. He joined the college coaching ranks as a wide receivers coach at Northern Colorado in 2020. He added offensive coordinator to his title in 2021 and held both roles for two seasons. McCaffrey joined the NFL coaching ranks as a member of former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel’s coaching staff in 2023, serving as an offensive assistant through the 2025 season. McCaffrey’s new role reunites him with McDaniel, who was hired as the Chargers’ offensive coordinator in January. 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey and Commanders WR Luke McCaffrey are Max’s younger brothers.</description>

      <title>Bengals signed CB Jalen Davis to a one-year contract extension through 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7cae-d042-afbc-7dfeff6c0000</link>
      <description>Davis broke up one pass and notched one interception last season. The Bengals also signed HB Kendall Milton to a one-year contract for the 2026 season. He has rushed twice in his career, totaling two yards.</description>

      <title>Cowboys released LB Logan Wilson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7cb1-d89c-a1be-ffffe0830000</link>
      <description>The Cowboys acquired Wilson via trade from the Bengals in early November and played his first game with the team in Week 11. During his time with the Cowboys, Wilson totaled 20 tackles, one pressure and one pass breakup. Wilson, 29, has decent odds of landing on a new team in free agency, though he may be best suited to a rotational role as a run defender. The Cowboys save $6.5 million by releasing him.</description>

      <title>Titans hired Tanzel Smart as their new assistant defensive line coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7cbf-d89c-a1be-ffffba320000</link>
      <description>Smart’s hiring reunites him with Titans head coach Robert Saleh. The two spent three seasons together with the Jets from 2021-2023. Smart won over Hard Knocks viewers in his final NFL season, vying for a roster spot during the Jets’ 2023 training camp. He entered the NFL’s coaching ranks last season, signing on as a defensive quality control assistant with the Cowboys.</description>

      <title>Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said QB Patrick Mahomes (knee) is “making progress every day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7d04-d042-afbc-7dd6bbc10000</link>
      <description>Per Reid, Mahomes is spending seven hours per day with Chiefs assistant athletic trainer and physical therapist Julie Frymyer. Reid notes that although rehab following a significant knee injury is “not going to be a pleasant thing,” Mahomes keeps showing up and Frymyer continues to challenge him and keeps him “on task.” The positive reports continue to trickle in for the veteran quarterback, who has a chance to be ready for Week 1.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports that Titans QB Cam Ward (shoulder) is “recovering well.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7dc8-d042-afbc-7dda60560000</link>
      <description>Ward suffered an AC joint sprain in his right, throwing shoulder late in the year. Ward has been doing “lower-body work” and is expected to resume throwing the football in March, roughly two-to-three weeks from now. Titans coaches are reportedly focused on correcting “some of the bad habits” Ward picked up last year by improving his “base.” We should have another update on Ward’s recovery in the next couple of weeks.</description>
