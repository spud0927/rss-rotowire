      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Jamaal Williams worked out for the Bears on Saturday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8f08-d05a-adda-af8a29e00000</link>
      <description>Williams ran for 1066 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2022 with the Lions, but has accumulated just 470 yards and two touchdowns in 27 games over the last two years with the Saints. The charismatic running back turned 30 in April. His potential addition would further complicate the backup running back spot for the Bears, where Roschon Johnson and rookie Kyle Monangai slot in behind D’Andre Swift.</description>

      <title>Morice Norris is in stable condition, according to a statement released by the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8efd-d90d-a5bd-aeff78250000</link>
      <description>Norris, who is competing for one of the Lions’ backup safety spots, had his head snap back and body go limp while making a tackle. He was transported to the hospital immediately and Friday night’s game between the Falcons and Lions was suspended. The news that Norris is in stable condition is as good as anyone could’ve hoped for at this point.</description>

      <title>Dylan Sampson rushed two times for six yards and caught 0-of-1 targets in the Browns’ preseason Week 1 game against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c89-d05a-adda-ae8b7fce0000</link>
      <description>Sampson got the start, taking 8-of-9 backfield snaps to begin the game while forcing one missed tackle along the way. Sampson remains a reasonable late-round dart throw, penciled in as the Browns’ No. 2 running back.</description>

      <title>Shedeur Sanders completed 14-of-23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns and rushed four times for 19 yards in the Browns’ preseason Week 1 game against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c83-d05a-adda-ae835af10000</link>
      <description>Sanders had his ups and downs but looked good completing passes over the middle. He also lost six yards via two sacks. All in all, this was a promising performance for the Browns’ No. 4 quarterback. It should be unsurprising for us to see him challenge Dillon Gabriel for the No. 3 role next week.</description>

      <title>Isaac TeSlaa caught 2-of-3 targets for 18 yards and one touchdown in the Lions’ preseason Week 1 game against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c77-d90d-a5bd-ae7fcbd00000</link>
      <description>TeSlaa continued his in-game acrobatics but this time, he produced a highlight-reel touchdown grab against a penciled-in starter. Teslaa snuck past slot CB Dee Alford in the red zone, beautifully high-pointed a pass from QB Kyle Allen and retained control of the football as Alford hit him in the air. The athletic rookie is earning more opportunities.</description>

      <title>New Orleans Football’s Nick Underhill reports that Chris Olave’s ankle injury is considered “insignificant.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c75-d45c-a7fc-8e7f84260000</link>
      <description>Olave sprained his ankle during Thursday’s practice but continued to practice through it. He was held out of today’s scrimmage in what is believed to be a “precautionary” move. Concerns over Olave’s concussion history have pushed his ADP into backend WR3 territory. The ankle issue will likely make him even more affordable. His upside likely falls in the mid-to-high WR2 but he is not without risk.</description>

      <title>Jacory Croskey-Merritt rushed seven times for 24 yards and caught 1-of-1 targets for eight yards in the Commanders’ preseason Week 1 game against the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c69-d05a-adda-aeeb5a360000</link>
      <description>The Commanders rested their first-team offense but Croskey-Merritt was on the field as a member of today’s starting group. His performance did not disappoint. “Bill” churned through arm tackles on inside runs and left a would-be tackler diving for air on his cross-field catch-and-run. It’s a good start for the promising rookie.</description>

      <title>Rhamondre Stevenson rushed seven times for 36 yards in the Patriots’ preseason Week 1 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c53-d05a-adda-aed36f2f0000</link>
      <description>Stevenson ran efficiently with the first team, averaging 5.0 yards per carry. He was outplayed by TreVeyon Henderson, however, who also played with the first-team offense. Stevenson is looking more like an upside-stash than a weekly fantasy contributor.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c53-d05a-adda-aed36f2f0000</guid>

      <title>TreVeyon Henderson rushed once for 18 yards, caught 3-of-3 targets for 12 yards and returned the opening kickoff for a 100-yard touchdown in the Patriots’ preseason Week 1 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c59-d90d-a5bd-ae5b7c030000</link>
      <description>Henderson established himself as the Patriots’ most explosive player on the very first play, weaving through traffic en route to the 100-yard return touchdown. Rhamondre Stevenson will remain involved in the Patriots’ offense as a north-south rusher but Henderson looks the part of a featured dual-threat weapon. He took four first-team reps to Stevenson’s five.</description>

      <title>Kyle Williams caught 0-of-3 targets in the Patriots’ preseason Week 1 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-8c4e-d05a-adda-aecec9070000</link>
      <description>Williams took first-team reps along with Mack Hollins, DeMario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte. Among the bunch, Williams is the only one who earned a target, though he did so with Joshua Dobbs at quarterback. Williams shook his defender at the Commanders’ five-yard line but Dobbs’ throw was late. Williams, Hollins and Boutte are still jockeying for position on the Patriots’ depth chart.</description>
