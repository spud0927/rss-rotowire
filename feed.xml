      <title>Raiders TE Michael Mayer (concussion) was a full participant in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c665-dd4c-afb9-e7e5d9460000</link>
      <description>Mayer has been sidelined with a concussion each of the last three weeks. He starts out Week 6 as a full participant in practice, indicating he is ready to return this week against the Titans. With Brock Bowers (knee) still hurting, Mayer is worth an add as a fill-in for fantasy managers with Bowers.</description>

      <title>Ravens S Kyle Hamilton (groin) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c66a-d94a-a79d-cf6f4b9e0000</link>
      <description>Hamilton practiced for the first time since getting in a limited session last Wednesday. The versatile 24-year-old safety is a key piece on the back end of the struggling Ravens’ secondary and would be a vital addition back to the defense if he returns against the Rams in Week 6. Also practicing was LT Ronnie Stanley (ankle). Both Hamilton and Stanley are cornerstone starters at their respective positions and their potential returns would boost a Ravens team that is off to a disappointing 1-4 start this season.</description>

      <title>Browns acquired CB Tyson Campbell and the Eagles’ 2026 seventh-round pick from the Jaguars in exchange for CB Greg Newsome and the Jets’ 2026 sixth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c6c9-def2-abdb-dfe9fc5d0000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Browns and Jaguars will be swapping late-round picks in addition to the cornerbacks. Campbell signed a four-year, $76.5 million extension in the 2024 offseason with the Jaguars and is now under contract through 2028 for Cleveland. He has six interceptions and 42 passes defended through his five-year career, but has missed 11 games over the last two seasons. The Jaguars swap him out for Greg Newsome, who is in the last season of his rookie deal. Newsome held a top-45 PFF coverage grade each of his first three seasons and has three interceptions and 37 passes defended through four total seasons. The Jags have flexibility at corner with Travis Hunter mixing in for snaps; his usage won’t decrease with Newsome joining him on the outside. Meanwhile, the Browns opt for Campbell’s long-term deal over negotiating a Newsome extension.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jordan Raanan believes Cam Skattebo is “the Giants’ future and present at running back.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c8fd-db72-a199-faffeb300000</link>
      <description>It’s quite the departure from Raanan’s August report that named Tyrone Tracy the unquestioned lead back after Skattebo sustained a hamstring injury in training camp. Skattebo has established himself as New York’s RB1 over the past few weeks with Tracy sidelined with a shoulder injury. Though Tracy is set to return to game action on Thursday night against the Eagles, Skattebo is expected to remain the team’s primary back. He has 48 touches over the past two games in a massively run-heavy Giants offense. He could go down as one of the most important fantasy selections in 2025.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Terry McLaurin (quad) is “not looking good” for Week 6 against the Bears.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c945-d94a-a79d-c94d9ea70000</link>
      <description>McLaurin did not practice Wednesday and would need to log at least a partial practice late in the week before Washington’s Monday night matchup against the Bears. McLaurin fantasy drafters should expect to be without McLaurin for at least one more week. Look for Deebo Samuel to dominate targets once again, with Luke McCaffrey mixing in as a downfield threat. McCaffrey is only flex viable in deeper formats.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Marcel Louis-Jacques reports there’s “no major concern” about Tua Tagovailoa’s thumb and hip injuries.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c97d-dd4c-afb9-effdafd90000</link>
      <description>Tagovailoa was limited during Wednesday’s practice, raising concerns about his Week 6 availability against the Chargers. As long as he practices in some capacity in the coming days, Tua should be good to go against LA. Tagovailoa last week against the Panthers completed 27-of-36 passes for 256 yards and three touchdowns in the Dolphins’ first game without Tyreek Hill (knee). He’ll be a low-ceiling top-15 fantasy option in Week 6.</description>

      <title>49ers general manager John Lynch said Mac Jones (knee) “should be OK” for Week 6 against the Bucs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c998-db72-a199-fbdb2a1a0000</link>
      <description>Jones is likely to be under center against the Bucs this weekend with Brock Purdy recovering from a setback to his toe injury. Jones was banged up in the second half of last week’s win against the Rams, struggling with a knee issue and leg cramps. Jones leads the NFL in passing yards over his past three games, throwing six touchdowns to just one interception. He should be started in superflex lineups this week against the pass-funnel Tampa Bay defense.</description>

      <title>Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said K Brandon McManus’ quad injury is “a major concern.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c9c3-d94a-a79d-c9cfc0870000</link>
      <description>Apparently McManus recently injured his quad in practice and seems iffy — at best — for Week 6 against the Bengals. The veteran has made seven of his nine field goal tries this season and 11 of his 12 extra point attempts. The Packers may need to find a replacement for McManus if he’s unable to practice in the coming days. Whoever kicks for the Packers will be fantasy viable against a wretched Bengals defense.</description>

      <title>Bills LB Matt Milano (pec) won’t practice Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c9df-d94a-a79d-c9dfc72d0000</link>
      <description>Milano would seem like a long shot to suit up this week against the Falcons. He suffered the pec injury in Week 4. Buffalo’s defense remains of the of most injury-marred in the NFL through five weeks, making the Bills vulnerable to a run-heavy Atlanta offense that came to life in Week 4 before the team’s bye week.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c9df-d94a-a79d-c9dfc72d0000</guid>

      <title>Broncos RB Tyler Badie (shoulder) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-c9e2-d94a-a79d-c9efdeae0000</link>
      <description>Badie was banged up in Week 5 against the Eagles but should be OK for Week 6 after being upgraded to a full practice on Thursday. Badie hasn’t seen a carry since Week 2 but has worked in as a pass catcher out of the Denver backfield alongside JK Dobbins and RJ Harvey. Badie has four targets over the past two games. He won’t be fantasy viable unless Dobbins or Harvey miss time this season.</description>
