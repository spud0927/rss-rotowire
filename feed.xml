      <title>SNY’s Connor Hughes reports the Giants are “big-game hunting” for a pass-catcher ahead of the trade deadline.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9ad-db72-a199-fbef33a30000</link>
      <description>Hughes named Jaylen Waddle, Chris Olave, and Jakobi Meyers are potential targets. At 2-4, the Giants aren’t the type of team you would expect to be buyers at the deadline, but Jaxson Dart has given them a new lease on life in a weakened NFC East this year. Even if the push proves futile for 2025, Dart will need more weapons to throw to next year, even once Malik Nabers is healthy. As Hughes notes, neither the Saints nor the Dolphins are inclined to trade their top wideout this early in the year. That, however, could change if both teams continue to lose games.</description>

      <title>Calvin Ridley (hamstring) did not practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9b8-db72-a199-fbfba2190000</link>
      <description>Ridley left the Titans’ Week 6 game against the Raiders in the second quarter and did not return. A DNP to start the week puts him on the wrong side of questionable for Week 7’s game against the Patriots. Van Jefferson led the Titans with 75 receiving yards on four catches in Ridley’s absence. Given the abysmal state of the Titans’ offense, it’s hard to recommend any of their wideouts as a FLEX option for Week 7, even with Ridley leaving plenty of targets up for grabs.</description>

      <title>Patriots EDGE Harold Landry (ankle) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9bf-d94a-a79d-e9bf45b30000</link>
      <description>Landry collided with one of his teammates in the first quarter of the Pats’ Week 6 win over the Saints and stayed on the field for a moment. He eventually walked off under his own power and managed to return to the game after a short stint with the medical staff. The former Titan already has 4.5 sacks this year, putting him on pace for a career-high in sacks. Losing Landry would be a big blow to the Patriots’ defense, though it’s hard to imagine the downtrodden Titans taking advantage of his absence, given the way they have played so far.</description>

      <title>Broncos designated LB Dre Greenlaw (quad) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9ce-db72-a199-fbcfc1ee0000</link>
      <description>Greenlaw suffered a torn quad in the offseason. He avoided IR or the PUP list to start the year but landed on injured reserve after Week 2. Though his recovery is clearly taking longer than expected, the fact that he was on injured reserve for the minimum of four weeks means he should be ready to go sooner rather than later. The Broncos now have three weeks to officially activate him from injured reserve.</description>

      <title>Garrett Wilson (knee) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9d1-dd4c-afb9-efd1ae510000</link>
      <description>Wilson suffered the knee injury in Week 6 against the Broncos. He played through the issue until the final whistle but immediately underwent an MRI on his knee. Though he avoided a serious injury, Wilson is reportedly expected to miss a couple of weeks. With Josh Reynolds also banged up, the Jets could be down to Arian Smith and Tyler Johnson as their top wideouts. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor should also see plenty of targets in Wilson’s absence.</description>

      <title>Deebo Samuel (heel) did not practice Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9d5-db72-a199-fbdffd070000</link>
      <description>Samuel was held out of practice on Wednesday and Thursday last week. He was upgraded to a limited session on Friday before being listed as questionable. Samuel ultimately played through the issue but managed just 19 tards on four grabs. With Terry McLaurin potentially returning this week, Samuel’s target total could continue to fall after seeing five looks in Week 6. While we expect him to play through the heel issue once again, Samuel will move to the end of the WR2 ranks for Week 7 versus Dallas.</description>

      <title>Terry McLaurin (quad) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9da-d94a-a79d-e9df68160000</link>
      <description>McLaurin went down with the quad injury in Week 2 and has not played since. This is his first practice in roughly a month. The Commanders could still hold him out for another week, but it’s looking more likely than not that he is out there on Sunday. Assuming he does suit up. McLaurin will return to the WR2 ranks for a phenomenal matchup versus a Dallas defense allowing the most fantasy points to opposing wideouts this year.</description>

      <title>Eagles CB Quinyon Mitchell (hamstring) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9e2-db72-a199-fbeb331f0000</link>
      <description>Mitchell suffered the hamstring injury in the second quarter of the Eagles’ Week 6 loss to the Giants. He did not return after halftime and was later ruled out. A limited practice this early in the week is a good sign for his availability ahead of Week 7. If healthy, Mitchell will be tasked with covering Justin Jefferson on Sunday.</description>

      <title>Eagles DT Jalen Carter (heel) is practicing in full for Week 7 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9e5-d94a-a79d-e9eddf510000</link>
      <description>Left guard Landon Dickerson (ankle) was limited in Wednesday’s practice. Both players missed the team’s Week 6 loss to the Eagles. Carter has already told reporters he plans to play on Sunday versus the Vikings. Dickerson isn’t guaranteed to return this week, but a limited practice is a step in the right direction for the veteran.</description>

      <title>Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy (ankle) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-e9f9-db72-a199-fbfbc44a0000</link>
      <description>McCarthy returned to practice after the Vikings’ bye, nearly five weeks after suffering the ankle injury that led the Vikings to start Carson Wentz instead. However, he was still a limited participant and ESPN’s Kevin Seifert reports McCarthy said his ankle is “not yet 100-percent.” Meanwhile, Wentz (shoulder) was a full participant in practice. Head coach Kevin O’Connell did not name a starter, but if early-week practice participation reports are any indication, Wentz is trending to start Week 7 against the Eagles.</description>
