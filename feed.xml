      <title>Buccaneers activated DL Calijah Kancey (pectoral) from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8099-d35e-a1bf-c5dbf7100000</link>
      <description>You don’t often see torn pectoral injuries suffered by defensive players recover enough to play in the same season they were hurt, but occasionally someone will do it. Kancey will probably be of limited effectiveness against the Panthers, but the Buccaneers are pulling out all the stops they can to keep their season alive in Week 18.</description>

      <title>Packers QB Malik Willis (shoulder/hamstring) is questionable to play in Week 18 against the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-8096-d35e-a1bf-c5d6a0640000</link>
      <description>Willis could suit up for backup duties, but we expect him to be the emergency third quarterback behind starting QB Clayton Tune and backup QB Desmond Ridder. Willis has been a valuable backup for the Packers this season. They will likely try to preserve his health for the playoffs.</description>

      <title>Texans CB Kamari Lassiter (ankle/knee) won’t play in Houston’s Week 18 game against the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-809e-d968-a19b-d8ff58310000</link>
      <description>That will unlock some of Indianapolis’ wideout options should Riley Leonard be able to aim the ball in their direction. Derek Stingley (oblique) is off the injury report, as is linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair. It doesn’t sound like Lassiter would be resting if this were a win-and-in game for the Texans.</description>

      <title>Jaguars RB Bhayshul Tuten (finger) is not on Jacksonville’s final Week 18 injury report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-80a1-d56e-afff-e6e9a69a0000</link>
      <description>Tuten has missed two weeks after having finger surgery, but looks like he’ll be available for Week 18. The Jaguars could give him a real run if they happen to script the Titans into submission early. If the Titans make a game of it, they’ll probably stick with Travis Etienne for the majority of the game. Tuten still has a little RB3 steam if active, especially given the Jaguars being 13.5-point favorites.</description>

      <title>Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said he does not expect WR Tory Horton (shin) to resume playing this season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-809c-dc7a-af9b-cfbf2a6c0000</link>
      <description>Horton reportedly injured his shin while rehabbing a groin injury in Week 10, just two days after the Seahawks acquired WR Rashid Shaheed via trade. It was an extremely unfortunate series of events for the young, speedy receiver and return specialist. Horton never retook the field after that. In Weeks 1-9, Horton caught 13-of-22 targets for 161 yards and five touchdowns. He also returned 16 punts for 238 yards and one touchdown. In Week 3, Horton set the franchise record for the longest punt return in Seahawks history, a 95-yard touchdown, and became the third Seahawk ever to score a punt return touchdown and a receiving touchdown in the same game. Horton’s fantasy viability in 2026 remains uncertain. The team could choose to re-sign Shaheed, an impending free agent, and WR Cooper Kupp is under contract through 2027.</description>

      <title>Eagles DL Jalen Carter (hip) won’t play in Philadelphia’s Week 18 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-80a8-d35e-a1bf-c5ea966e0000</link>
      <description>Carter, Jaelan Phillips (ankle), and Nakobe Dean (hamstring) were all ruled out and should all get better around the time Philadelphia’s first Wild Card playoff report comes out. Until then, it will be Philadelphia’s reserves dealing with Josh Johnson, Chris Rodriguez, and “Bill” Croskey-Merritt. Week 18 is here.</description>

      <title>Eagles RT Lane Johnson (foot) won’t play in Philadelphia’s Week 18 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-80aa-d968-a19b-d8fbd0420000</link>
      <description>Johnson hasn’t played or practiced since Week 11, but did show up at the facility today. He will almost certainly try to give it a go in the Wild Card Round, but with no practice sessions it may be touch-and-go for Johnson.</description>

      <title>Eagles TE Dallas Goedert (knee) will not play in Philadelphia’s Week 18 game against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-80ae-d35e-a1bf-c5ee3dd70000</link>
      <description>Grant Calcaterra! Tanner McKee! It’s not quite the UFL, but you wouldn’t know it! We expect Goedert to be healthy for Philadelphia’s first Wild Card round injury report.</description>

      <title>Raiders coach Pete Carroll declined to say whether Kenny Pickett or Aidan O’Connell will start against the Chiefs in Week 18.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-80af-dc7a-af9b-cfbf7ac10000</link>
      <description>Has anyone tried asking the Raiders to be normal? We’re just asking questions here. Carroll said both players would play. Neither player is worth rostering in superflex leagues in Week 18. O’Connell has probably performed like a better quarterback but spent all season buried on the depth chart for reasons that defy rational explanation.</description>
