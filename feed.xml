      <title>Jaguars have acquired WR Tim Patrick from the Lions in exchange for a 2026 sixth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-eb67-d332-a1fd-ff771b1c0000</link>
      <description>Patrick joined the Lions last year and had 394 yards and three touchdowns. The 31-year-old provided size at 6-foot-5 as well as production. He figures to take on a similar role with the Jaguars, who were looking for a bigger receiver that can also block. For the Lions, rookie Isaac Teslaa could be in line to replace Patrick as the WR3 after a loud preseason where he had three touchdowns. Kalif Raymond will also be in that mix. Detroit could’ve kept Patrick around as a depth option this year, but opted to recoup some draft capital after trading up to take Teslaa. The Lions gave Patrick as $2.5 million contract this offseason that included a $1.25 million signing bonus, which the Lions will retain as a dead cap hit after the trade. Patrick’s fantasy stock was nearly nonexistent with the Lions and doesn’t seem to have improved much at all going to a similarly crowded Jaguars receiver room.</description>

      <title>Lions signed S Daniel Thomas.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-eb83-d332-a1fd-ffb7d1ef0000</link>
      <description>Thomas had spent his entire five-year career with the Jaguars, but was released earlier this week. The Lions were looking for depth at the safety position since seventh-round pick Dan Jackson went on injured reserve in training camp. Thomas was considered a special teams ace with the Jaguars and figures to have most of his impact on special teams with the Lions as well.</description>

      <title>Bills signed S Jordan Poyer.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-eba5-de13-afdc-efef37b40000</link>
      <description>Poyer made first-team All-Pro in 2021 and went to the Pro Bowl in 2022 while playing with the Bills. The 34-year-old safety spent 2024 with the Dolphins, where he started 16 games and had 98 tackles. The Bills already have Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp as starting safeties and Poyer was brought back as a member of the practice squad.</description>
