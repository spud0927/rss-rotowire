      <title>Bengals signed TE Tanner Hudson to a one-year contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d709-d35e-a1bf-d7cbbeaf0000</link>
      <description>Hudson, 31, was playing on an expiring deal this season but is now locked in for 2026. The veteran tight end played on 148 offensive snaps this season, per PFF, and has never been used as anything more than a backup since entering the league in 2019. He caught 19 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns this season.</description>

      <title>Patriots HC Mike Vrabel said “I can’t be certain right now” when asked if Mack Hollins (abdomen) could play in the AFC Championship game against the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d725-d968-a19b-dff5005b0000</link>
      <description>Vrabel said the team is “still working through everything with some of those guys that could be back,’ so it’s unlikely we learn much about Hollins’ availability before the Patriots release their first injury report on Wednesday. Hollins hasn’t played since Week 16 and has yet to practice since going down. The veteran receiver has come up big on various occasions for the Patriots this season and would be a welcomed addition to the offense against a top-flight Broncos defense.</description>

      <title>Bears TE Colston Loveland suffered a concussion in Sunday’s Divisional round loss to the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d744-dc7a-af9b-dfffe2c20000</link>
      <description>Loveland was injured late in the fourth quarter in Sunday’s loss to the Rams and was not available for any of the team’s offensive snaps in overtime. Loveland, who caught 58 passes for 713 yards and six touchdowns as a rookie, should make a full recovery in the coming days and will be primed for a breakout 2026 campaign after an impressive rookie year.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports former Bills HC Sean McDermott plans to continue coaching in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d74e-d968-a19b-dfff1e830000</link>
      <description>The recently-fired McDermott will be one of the hottest names on the market and is now free to speak with other teams. With seven other teams still looking to secure their next head coach, McDermott will have plenty of suitors to consider as interviews start lining up. McDermott led the Bills to eight postseason births in his nine years at the helm, while going 98-50 in the regular season. Even if he’s unable to land a head coaching gig, McDermott will be in high-demand for several defensive coordinator positions that need filled.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports the Ravens will hold a second interview with Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d74f-d56e-afff-f7efd4cd0000</link>
      <description>Weaver now has second interviews scheduled with both the Ravens and Steelers, and is scheduled to meet with the Ravens on Tuesday. Weaver spent four seasons with the Ravens as a player from 2002 to 2005, and also worked under John Harbaugh from 2021 to 2023. He’s received several head coaching interviews in recent years since joining the coaching ranks, and could finally be on the verge of securing his first head-coaching gig this coaching cycle.</description>

      <title>Dolphins completed their interview with Lions DC Kelvin Sheppard for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d75b-dc7a-af9b-dfff8eb90000</link>
      <description>The Dolphins were the first team to interview Sheppard this coaching cycle. The first-year defensive coordinator saw his defense rank 22nd in points allowed and 18th in yards allowed in his first year at the helm, but the Lions again dealt with several injuries on the defensive side of the ball.</description>

      <title>Seahawks HC Mike Macdonald said Zach Charbonnet (knee) will undergo surgery after being injured in Saturday’s Divisional round win over the 49ers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d769-d56e-afff-f7e9d07f0000</link>
      <description>Macdonald said Charbonnet has “a significant knee injury” and followed that up by saying “he’s got a good long road to come back.” The team later confirmed it as a torn ACL. It’s a tough blow to the third-year back who rushed for a season-high 730 yards and 12 touchdowns this season, and added another 20 receptions for 144 scoreless yards. Charbonnet’s 2025 season is now over, and the severity of his knee injury puts his availability for the start of next season in doubt. Kenneth Walker will likely handle the majority of the backfield workload for the majority of the playoffs and could be a lock to return to the team in 2026 with Charbonnet’s availability now in doubt.</description>

      <title>Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said LT Charles Cross (foot) is “day to day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d76e-d35e-a1bf-d7ee37660000</link>
      <description>It sounds like he’ll have a good shot at playing in the NFC Championship game against the Rams based on that quote. Cross left the Divisional Round win over the 49ers in the second half and it was said after the game that he likely could have come back if the score wasn’t lopsided.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers requested permission to interview Bengals OC Dan Pitcher for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d780-d968-a19b-dff1ca270000</link>
      <description>It’s a lateral move, however, Pitcher would be leaving for a job where he’d actually get to call plays. Head coach Zac Taylor actually gave Pitcher the chance to interview even though he could have blocked it. It’s eye-catching, if nothing else. Pitcher joins a crowded OC interview pool for the Bucs that includes Mike McDaniel, Brian Callahan, Zac Robinson, Mike Kafka, and Todd Monken.</description>

      <title>Raiders completed their interview with former Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d796-d968-a19b-dff72fa90000</link>
      <description>McDaniel has now met with the Browns, Ravens, and Raiders to discuss their head-coaching vacancies and interviewed with the Buccaneers to discuss their opening at offensive coordinator. The former Dolphins coach has plenty of suitors on the open market, but he seems unlikely to take a job as a coordinator until he has explored all possible options for head coaching gigs. McDaniel already has a second interview with the Browns lined up, which will presumably take place later this week.</description>
