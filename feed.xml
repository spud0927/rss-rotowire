      <title>The state of Kansas approved a massive subsidy deal to build the Chiefs a stadium in Wyandotte County for the 2031 season.</title>

      <description>If you didn’t know this, the Chiefs currently play in Missouri. They are now expected to cross state lines and leave the Show Me state without an NFL franchise and abandon Arrowhead Stadium. (It turns out that no matter how many times we were forced to say “GEHA Field” it wasn’t enough to create as much money for the Chiefs ownership group as a new stadium.) The Chiefs are targeting a 2031 move and a state-of-the-art domed stadium in Wyandotte County with a training facility in Olathe. Between the Patrick Mahomes injury, becoming the only team in the NFL to be convincingly pantsed by the Titans in 2025, and this, it’s been a momentous few weeks for Chiefs fans.</description>

      <title>Rams HC Sean McVay said the team will monitor Davante Adams (hamstring) throughout the week ahead of Week 17’s game against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-47bf-d35e-a1bf-47ffaa240000</link>
      <description>Speaking with the media on Monday, McVay did not rule out the possibility of Adams playing in Week 17 against the Falcons. McVay said Adams is making progress toward a return, but didn’t provide much additional detail. With the Rams playing on Monday night, fantasy managers will want to keep a close watch on Adams’ practice status throughout the week and have a plan in place if he enters the week with a questionable tag.</description>

      <title>Patriots WR DeMario Douglas (hamstring) left New England’s Week 16 game against the Ravens and did not return.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-47c7-d35e-a1bf-47c71dd70000</link>
      <description>Initially questionable, he did not actually come back to the game. We’ll see what gets said this week, but it looks like Kyle Williams absorbed most of his snaps. Williams could be a DFS flyer or low-level FLEX option in Week 17 against the Jets.</description>

      <title>Chiefs placed QB Gardner Minshew (knee) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-47cd-d968-a19b-5ffdf9980000</link>
      <description>Minshew received good news regarding his knee injury on Monday, but with just two weeks left in the regular season, it was apparent he would not be able to return in time to avoid the IR designation. The seventh-year signal-caller signed a one-year contract with the Chiefs this offseason but only appeared in two games. One of the better backups the league has to offer, Minshew should have no trouble finding a new home in 2026, given the current state of the quarterback landscape across the league.</description>

      <title>Commanders QB Marcus Mariota (hand/quad) did not practice Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-47d2-d968-a19b-5ff33f390000</link>
      <description>Not really breaking any news here to tell you that while Mariota playing is still in play, per Dan Quinn, he’s trending in the direction of not playing based on practice reports and common sense. Josh Johnson would be a rough superflex QB3 if he were to draw the Week 17 assignment.</description>

      <title>Commanders placed WR Jaylin Lane (ankle) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-47e6-dc7a-af9b-cfff3bab0000</link>
      <description>This ends his season. Lane left Saturday’s game with the injury on a punt return, further ruining the back of the Commanders’ emergency quarterback depth chart. The fourth-round rookie cracked 50 receiving yards once, but was usually an ancillary target when one of Deebo Samuel or Terry McLaurin was healthy. Sometimes we can see big leaps out of a player in their sophomore season, but nothing Lane has done so far has led us to believe he’s going to be more than a lower-roster receiver with special teams upside.</description>

      <title>Bills HC Sean McDermott said Josh Allen is considered day-to-day with the foot injury he suffered in Week 16’s win over the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-47ed-d968-a19b-5ffde8650000</link>
      <description>Allen was injured late in the second quarter of Sunday’s win over the Browns, but never missed a play on offense. The injury didn’t appear too serious on Sunday, and McDermott’s designation of Allen as day-to-day suggests this is something he will have no trouble playing through. Barring an unexpected setback, we would expect Allen to be under center for Week 17 against the Eagles.</description>

      <title>Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee) did not practice on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4801-d968-a19b-58f1a11d0000</link>
      <description>It’s an estimated report, but it’s a new listing. St. Brown played through the entire game with the injury, notably being called for a game-ending offensive pass interference penalty on the final play. Lions coach Dan Campbell said he’s “hopeful it’s just irritation from yesterday’s game.” This will be a developing situation to watch ahead of Week 17’s finals in most leagues. We’d tentatively expect St. Brown to play based on him finishing last week’s game and the Lions absolutely needing the game to stay alive in the playoff chase, but it is a short week.</description>

      <title>Cardinals placed DT Walter Nolen (knee) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-4808-d56e-afff-eee82aa10000</link>
      <description>Nolen winds up with only 169 defensive snaps in 2025 between a Week 1-8 calf injury, a Week 12-14 knee injury, and this latest cart-off against the Falcons in Week 16. He had a 74.1 PFF defensive grade, but obviously the Cardinals will be hoping for a little more availability going forward in the second year of Nolen’s rookie contract.</description>

      <title>Cardinals placed CB Garrett Williams (Achilles) on injured reserve, ending his season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-47f5-d56e-afff-e7fd7be20000</link>
      <description>Head coach Jonathan Gannon confirmed on Monday that Williams would miss the remainder of the season. The former third-round pick suffered a torn Achilles in Week 16’s loss to the Falcons and will now spend the next several months rehabbing in hopes of returning sometime in 2026. Williams started all 10 games he appeared in this season for the Cardinals, totaling 46 tackles, five pass breakups, one interception, and one forced fumble.</description>
