      <title>KPRC2’s Aaron Wilson reports Nico Collins (concussion) “is doing well and trending toward a return at this point.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-2696-d5d8-a3ff-fff71db40000</link>
      <description>It’s a far more useful quote than what head coach DeMeco Ryans had to say about Collins. When asked if Collins was still in concussion protocol, Ryans kindly responded, “We’ll see where he is later in the week.” Wilson’s report comes from a source familiar with the situation, so we’ll assume that the star receiver at least has a chance to return in Week 9 against the Broncos. Collins’ status will be one to monitor when the Texans release their first injury report on Wednesday.</description>

      <title>Rams acquired CB Roger McCreary from the Titans in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round pick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-269e-d245-adfb-b7dfc4ab0000</link>
      <description>In addition to McCreary, the Titans also also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. The former second-round corner is in his fourth year as a pro and has been one of the very few bright spots for the Titans. This season, per PFF, McCreary has allowed 24 receptions for 250 yards and two touchdowns on 28 targets while also tallying one interception. He’s played almost exclusively as a slot corner over the last two seasons and should provide immediate help to a Rams secondary that’s clearly hoping to improve in time for a postseason push.</description>

      <title>Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said “my focus is where we are right now, that’s not my focus” when asked about starting Shedeur Sanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-26b6-d5d8-a3ff-fff783e90000</link>
      <description>In other words, there’s zero sign that the organization is interested in giving Sanders a shot right now over their higher-drafted rookie quarterback, Dillon Gabriel. Gabriel has struggled to push the ball downfield and Cleveland’s pass offense is nothing but tight ends since he took over the role. Still, it doesn’t sound like Stefanski has much interest in giving Sanders a shake.</description>

      <title>Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said Quinshon Judkins (shoulder) is “day to day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-26b9-d5d8-a3ff-fff901480000</link>
      <description>Based on that update, we’re not too concerned about Judkins missing time after Cleveland’s Week 9 bye. We’re sure he’ll be listed on the injury report ahead of Week 10, but ‘day to day’ is about as good an update as we could have seen on Judkins and this saps any reason to hold Dylan Sampson as an injury hedge through the bye.</description>

      <title>Broncos HC Sean Payton did not have an update on Patrick Surtain’s shoulder injury after Week 8’s win over the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-26ae-d245-adfb-b7ff1ae00000</link>
      <description>Payton may opt to play this one close to the vest ahead of Week 9’s game against the Texans. Surtain was initially listed as questionable to return after exiting, but never made it back to the field. Surtain’s status will be one to monitor when the team releases its first injury report on Wednesday, but any DNPs late in the week could point to him missing Week 9.</description>

      <title>Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said Cedric Tillman (hamstring/IR) is expected to return after the team’s bye week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-26bc-deb1-a39b-27be98a90000</link>
      <description>Unfortunately, with Joe Flacco gone, there’s not much of a reason to actually want Tillman starting for your fantasy team. Dillon Gabriel simply can’t connect with wideouts right now, and Tillman’s high-target floor is meaningless if Gabriel can’t even make Jerry Jeudy productive. Anyone who stashed Tillman in a non-keeper league can probably freely cut bait for a better injury hold at this point.</description>

      <title>Panthers coach Dave Canales said that Carolina “cannot ignore the fact that Rico (Dowdle) has been exceptional.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-26c5-d245-adfb-b7dfcb630000</link>
      <description>Canales said that he hasn’t discussed with Chuba Hubbard “what it might possibly look like with him taking a lesser role.” It’s been hard to believe how much Dowdle has outproduced Hubbard, who may still be dealing with a calf injury. It does sound like Dowdle will be closer to an RB1 role going forward and he should stumble into a pretty decent spot against Green Bay in Week 9, even if the defensive matchup isn’t a clear boost.</description>

      <title>Carson Wentz was not spotted at Monday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-26c7-deb1-a39b-27cfcdc00000</link>
      <description>This absence is presumably due to the injury to his non-throwing shoulder he dealt with ahead of Thursday night’s game against the Chargers. Wentz took a bit of a beating from the Chargers’ defense in that game, so his absence on Monday is notable. Monday’s practice won’t show up on the team’s injury report, which is released on Wednesday, but even if he is able to play in Week 9, Wentz is most likely to backup J.J. McCarthy, who is making his long-awaited return from an ankle injury he suffered in Week 2.</description>

      <title>Panthers coach Dave Canales said Bryce Young (ankle) could practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-26c9-d245-adfb-b7dfe6e80000</link>
      <description>We remain a little more skeptical on Young returning this week given they’ll only speak in possibilities, but Andy Dalton’s performance yesterday is certainly extra fuel to get Young up and ready as soon as possible. Young didn’t practice all last week after suffering a high-ankle sprain in Week 7.</description>
