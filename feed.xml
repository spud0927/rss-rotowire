      <title>49ers signed WR Kendrick Bourne, formerly of the Patriots, to a one-year contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a1f-db7b-a5dd-aa1fadb20000</link>
      <description>Bourne’s signing comes a week after he met with the Niners to discuss a possible reunion, and less than 24 hours after Jauan Jennings suffered a shoulder injury in Sunday’s win over the Seahawks. Bourne was let go by the Patriots during roster cutdowns last month and underwhelmed to the tune of 28-305-1 in 12 games after returning from a torn ACL he suffered in 2023. After spending the first four years of his career with the Niners in Kyle Shanahan’s offense, Bourne, who was dealing with a foot sprain this summer, is cleared to play and could make for an easy plug-and-play from an offensive perspective, but it’s hard to imagine him having much, if any, fantasy value at this time. He can earn up to $5 million on his one-year deal.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports the Saints fear S Julian Blackmon suffered a torn labrum in Week 1’s loss to the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a48-d332-a1fd-be7e35da0000</link>
      <description>The Saints are still conducting more tests to confirm the severity of Blackmon’s injury, but Rapoport reports the sixth-year safety could be looking at season-ending surgery if the worst is confirmed. The Saints signed Blackmon to a one-year deal this offseason after he was let go by the Colts at the end of last season, and he made the start for the Saints on Sunday against the Cards, appearing on 66 defensive snaps while totaling seven tackles and one pass breakup. We’ll know more about the specifics of his injury soon, but it would be a tough blow to a defense that’s already expected to face its share of struggles this season.</description>

      <title>Giants HC Brian Daboll confirmed Russell Wilson will start in Week 2 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a5c-db7b-a5dd-aa5c99260000</link>
      <description>Daboll continues to love the pain. Wilson wasn’t disastrous in Week 1 against the Commanders, but he didn’t do anything to extend what is presumably an already very short leash. After declining to commit to Russ on Sunday, Daboll will again put Mr. Unlimited under center in Week 2 against the Cowboys. The Cowboys limited the duo of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith to a combined 4-24-0 line in Week 1, and that was with a perfectly capable QB in Jalen Hurts under center. It’s hard to imagine Wilson and Malik Nabers faring a whole lot better in Week 2, so we wouldn’t rule out a switch to Jaxson Dart if the game gets off to a rocky start.</description>

      <title>Chiefs coach Andy Reid said Xavier Worthy (shoulder) is “day to day.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a75-dbe3-a9bb-3a77e4250000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes this is an indication that “the plan is to rehab and attempt to play with a brace -- rather than immediate surgery.” We’ll see how well Worthy plays through the obvious limitations — his practice statuses this week should be among the most-monitored — but it sounds like there’s at least a chance he’s able to be ready for the Eagles in Week 2.</description>

      <title>Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said James Daniels (pectoral) is “week-to-week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a90-d332-a1fd-beb6d2250000</link>
      <description>It’s not a “season-ending injury” but Daniels will for sure miss this week’s game. Daniels was only able to play three snaps in the opener before being replaced by Kion Smith. We’d be unsurprised if Daniels went on IR ahead of Week 2.</description>

      <title>Browns HC Kevin Stefanski said “we’ll see” when asked if Quinshon Judkins would play in Week 2 against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a8b-de13-afdd-6ecb53120000</link>
      <description>While there’s been some belief that Judkins could suit up as early as next week against the Ravens, Stefanski has opted not to commit to the rookie seeing the field to start the week. Stefanski said the Browns “gotta get through the week of practice” before determining how the backfield could look in Week 2, but with Judkins now under contract and practicing with the team, the expectation is he will see the field sooner rather than later. Judkins missed all of training camp after his arrest for domestic battery in July, but the rookie will not face any charges stemming from the arrest. It’s still possible he faces some kind of suspension from the league, but Judkins’ return will immediately cut into the workload that Dylan Sampson and Jerome Ford saw in Week 1 against the Bengals.</description>

      <title>Colts coach Shane Steichen said CB Charvarius Ward (head) is in concussion protocol after displaying symptoms Monday morning.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a96-de13-afdd-6edf2bff0000</link>
      <description>Just what the Colts needed: Another CB injury. We’ll monitor this one ahead of Week 2 but it would not be ideal for the Colts to be down their best outside coverage player against Courtland Sutton and the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan M. Alexander reports Texans TE Cade Stover suffered a broken foot and will be out indefinitely.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a9a-de13-afdd-6edb1e2b0000</link>
      <description>The Texans will turn to Harrison Bryant as their TE2. Stover was surprisingly involved in Week 1, being targeted four times. The second-year tight end might be looking at a second-straight year of the injured reserve list.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a9a-de13-afdd-6edb1e2b0000</guid>

      <title>Lions coach Dan Campbell said Detroit plans to use WR Isaac TeSlaa “more on offense moving forward.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2a9d-dbe3-a9bb-3adfa56c0000</link>
      <description>Campbell explained away TeSlaa’s lack of involvement in Week 1 by noting his illness and missing practice kept them from wanting to load him up too much. TeSlaa caught a touchdown on his only target, playing just three snaps. What “more” is could be anything, but we’d start expectations for Week 2 at maybe 20-30 snaps as TeSlaa works to dislodge Kalif Raymond from the WR3 role. He’s by no means a must-start, but a worthy bench stash as waivers open this week.</description>

      <title>Titans coach Brian Callahan said he hopes to have more clarity on OT JC Latham (hip) by Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-2aa6-de13-afdd-6eef593b0000</link>
      <description>Latham left Week 1’s game after playing 45 of 57 snaps, giving way to Olisaemeka Udoh at right tackle. It would be a huge loss for the Titans if Latham was sent to injured reserve.</description>
