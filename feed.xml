      <title>Seahawks WR Rashid Shaheed (concussion) was limited on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-71c2-d35e-a1bf-75c29bd90000</link>
      <description>This is a positive update for Shaheed, who was forced from last week’s game against the Panthers. The Seahawks face the 49ers on Saturday, and the winner takes home the NFC West crown while also securing the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Having Shaheed on the field would be extremely helpful for Seahawks QB Sam Darnold.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Ravens QB Lamar Jackson (back) is expected to practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74aa-d35e-a1bf-75ea354a0000</link>
      <description>Jackson missed Week 17’s matchup with the Packers after suffering a back contusion against the Patriots in the previous week. While the 28-year-old quarterback’s absence was unfortunate for fantasy managers in the championship round of the playoffs, the Ravens still beat the Packers without Jackson, setting up a winner-take-all date with the Steelers this week. Rapoport said the Ravens thought Jackson would play last week, but he wasn’t even able to practice. He’s expected back on the practice field Wednesday and it’s difficult to imagine him missing a game of this magnitude without a setback.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel “would be a candidate in Cleveland, should the Dolphins move on and Cleveland’s job open.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74b6-d968-a19b-7cf793ad0000</link>
      <description>10 days ago, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported McDaniel is expected to be back with the Dolphins. Fowler isn’t as sure, stating that while McDaniel has some support there, the team’s search for a new GM will be more about finding the best fit for the team rather than the best fit with McDaniel. Fowler even floats the idea that the Browns coaching position could come open by the team trading Kevin Stefanski to the Giants. While it’s all rumors and conjecture for now, the NFL’s coaching cycle will be in full force shortly after the final week of the regular season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Browns HC Kevin Stefanski would be an ideal fit with the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74c2-d968-a19b-7cf3bb530000</link>
      <description>Fowler reported earlier this week that the Browns have done preliminary research on a coaching change. Now the NFL Insider believes Stefanski would be an ideal fit for the Giants. The 43-year-old Browns coach is still under contract and Fowler floats the possibility that the team could trade him to the Giants, rather than fire him. While it’s unclear what the Giants’ level of interest in Stefanski is, Notre Dame’s Marcus Freeman removed his name from consideration for the position earlier this week. Expect the NFL’s coaching cycle to heat up next week after the conclusion of the regular season.</description>

      <title>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McLane reports Eagles QB Jalen Hurts and most starters are expected to rest in Week 18 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74c8-dc7a-af9b-ffff53210000</link>
      <description>McLane’s report comes on the heels of a report from NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo Tuesday essentially saying the same thing. The Eagles could earn the No. 2 seed in the NFC with a win and a Bears loss to the Lions, but it appears they’ll try to move up with Tanner McKee under center rather than Hurts. For fantasy managers still playing for something in Week 18, McKee and Tank Bigsby would be the top waiver wire priorities.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Browns signed C Kingsley Eguakun off the Lions practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-74fb-d35e-a1bf-75fb1f3c0000</link>
      <description>Eguakun is on his way to Cleveland just when it seemed like he got his foot in the door in Detroit. The 24-year-old center has been with the Lions organization for two years and was elevated to the active roster to start in place of the injured Graham Glasgow each of the last two weeks. Lions coach Dan Campbell told reporters after Week 16’s game against the Steelers that he was very encouraged by Eguakun’s performance. Curiously, the Lions didn’t sign him to the active roster themselves. After a subpar performance against the Vikings on Christmas Day, which included a bad snap that turned into a lost fumble, the Browns signed him as a depth piece.</description>

      <title>49ers GM John Lynch told KNBR that he’d be “very surprised” if TE George Kittle didn’t play in Week 18 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7533-d968-a19b-7df396d10000</link>
      <description>Kittle was a limited participant in 49ers practice Tuesday. Head coach Kyle Shanahan went as far as to say that Kittle had a chance to play this week. Lynch is more optimistic, essentially saying that a return from Kittle this week is more likely than not. If he has to sit out again, Jake Tonges is coming off a game with seven catches, 60 yards and a touchdown as Kittle’s replacement last week.</description>

      <title>Colts head coach Shane Steichen told reporters QB Riley Leonard will start in Week 18 against the Texans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-753b-dc7a-af9b-ffbff8c10000</link>
      <description>Leonard, a sixth-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, threw for 145 yards and an interception in relief of Daniel Jones in Week 14 against the Jaguars. The Colts were so impressed with Leonard’s performance that they immediately signed 44-year-old Philip Rivers. While Rivers wasn’t able to keep the Colts in playoff contention, he proved that he gave the Colts a better chance to win than the Notre Dame rookie. Leonard was known for his rushing ability in college, which is the only aspect of his game that’s interesting for fantasy purposes. In what’s essentially a preseason game with the Colts already eliminated, Leonard draws a difficult matchup against the Texans vaunted pass rush.</description>

      <title>49ers GM John Lynch told reporters RB Christian McCaffrey (back) is trending towards playing in Week 18 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7548-d56e-afff-f7e8cb020000</link>
      <description>The 49ers had a walkthrough Tuesday and McCaffrey was listed as out with a back injury. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan told reports the 29-year-old running back’s back is “a little stiff.” Trainers tended to CMC’s back in the fourth quarter of the win over the Bears in Week 17, with McCaffrey returning to finish the game. With Lynch saying that he’s trending towards playing, fantasy managers can expect McCaffrey to be available in Week 18. Brian Robinson is the clear handcuff to roster if anything changes.</description>

      <title>Cardinals WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel) is out for Week 18 against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-754f-d968-a19b-7dff7e170000</link>
      <description>Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said Harrison would continue to play through his heel injury this week if he was healthy enough. It turns out that the 23-year-old receiver isn’t healthy enough after hurting his other foot in the Week 17 loss to the Bengals. Harrison wasn’t having much of an impact with one catch in the last two games since returning to the lineup. With Harrison out, Michael Wilson is a must-start option for fantasy managers. Wilson is the WR3 over the last seven weeks behind only Puka Nacua and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. He needs 93 yards in Week 18 to have his first 1,000-yard season.</description>
