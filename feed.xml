      <title>Jets HC Aaron Glenn said Breece Hall (knee) will be questionable for Week 8 against the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-16dc-dab4-a3fb-9ffcc8940000</link>
      <description>Glenn said Hall is trending in the right direction after being limited in Wednesday and Thursday’s practices. The Jets RB1 doesn’t appear to be at risk of missing Week 8’s game against the Bengals in what should be a plus matchup, but fantasy managers will want to keep an eye on inactives when they are released 90 minutes before kickoff.</description>

      <title>Josh Palmer (knee/ankle) will not play in Week 8 against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-16e8-deb1-a39b-37ee84920000</link>
      <description>Palmer did not log a practice this week and has been ruled out ahead of Friday’s practice. The veteran receiver has logged two or fewer catches in all but one game this season and wasn’t going to be on the fantasy radar in Week 8 even with six teams on bye. His replacements, Elijah Moore and/or Curtis Samuel can also be left out of lineups.</description>

      <title>DaQuan Jones (calf) will not play in Week 8 against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-16ec-dab4-a3fb-9ffcdfbf0000</link>
      <description>Jones suffered a calf injury while warming up for Week 6’s game against the Falcons and was unable to suit up for that game. Its been two weeks since the injury, but the veteran tackle was still unable to get on the practice field this week and has now been ruled out for Sunday’s contest against the Panthers.</description>

      <title>Eagles HC Nick Sirianni declined to give an update on A.J. Brown’s (hamstring) Week 8 availability against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-16f1-dab4-a3fb-9ff18fc50000</link>
      <description>On the bright side, Sirianni did say Brown is a player who could suit up on Sunday even if he doesn’t practice during the week. With two DNPs already on his ledger for the week, a third DNP on Friday would theoretically put Brown on the wrong side of playing Sunday against the Giants, but his status may remain one to watch up until inactives are announced 90 minutes before kickoff. The Eagles haven’t released their final injury report for the week, which could provide a bit more clarity on Brown’s availability once it’s made public.</description>

      <title>Bills ruled out S Taylor Rapp (knee) for Week 8 against the Panthers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-16f1-deb1-a39b-37ff93de0000</link>
      <description>Rapp was a DNP in practice all week and will now be ruled out as a result. The seven-year vet has started all six games he’s appeared in for the Bills this season, totaling 26 tackles thus far. Cam Lewis is listed behind Rapp on the depth chart and will likely draw the start in his absence.</description>

      <title>Lamar Jackson (hamstring) was seen practicing on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-16f9-d245-adfb-97ffb35d0000</link>
      <description>The Ravens will release their final injury report shortly, but three-straight practices for Jackson, even if in a limited capacity, would be a great sign for his Week 8 availabiliy. The one-win Ravens desperately need the two-time MVP to make his return if they hope to have any chance of sneaking into the playoffs following their unprecedented start to the season. A win over the Bears would be exactly what they need if they hope to turn the tide. We will check back in with Jackson’s status once the final injury report is released.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports Derwin James Jr. is believed to have suffered a low-ankle sprain in Week 8’s win over the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-16fb-d5d8-a3ff-fffbf2ca0000</link>
      <description>According to Pelissero, James will undergo an MRI to confirm, but the hope is the veteran safety has avoided the worst here. James was injured in the first half of Sunday’s win and ruled out in the second-half, but if this injury doesn’t prove to be anything major, it’s possible James will be good to go when the Chargers face the Titans in Week 9.</description>

      <title>Haason Reddick (ankle/knee) will not play in Week 8 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1711-dab4-a3fb-9f711bde0000</link>
      <description>Reddick, along with OG Luke Haggard (shoulder), have been ruled out for Sunday’s game. Reddick has totaled 1.5 sacks in seven games for the Buccaneers this season while also breaking up one pass. It’s the first missed game of the season for Reddick, who was unable to practice this week and now sets his sights to Week 10 with the Buccaneers having a Week 9 bye on tap.</description>

      <title>Panthers listed Bryce Young (ankle) as doubtful for Week 8 against the Bills.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-171c-dab4-a3fb-9f7cccc80000</link>
      <description>This was to be expected after Young failed to take the practice field during the first two days of the week. Before that, it was reported by NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero that Young’s injury was the kind that “is generally a 2-4 week injury,” setting an early precedent that the Panthers’ QB1 would miss at least one game, and perhaps multiple. The doubtful designation foreshadows Young being ruled out sooner or later, paving the way for Andy Dalton to start vs. the Bills. Dalton could be on the fantasy radar for superflex or 2QB leagues with six teams on bye this week.</description>

      <title>The NFL announced the Giants have been fined $200k for violating the league’s concussion protocol in Week 6’s game against the Eagles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1720-deb1-a39b-372ed1f10000</link>
      <description>In addition to the team being fined, head coach Brian Daboll was also fined $100k for his involvement, while rookie RB Cam Skattebo was fine $15k for his involvement. In a joint statement released by the NFL and NFLPA, the league reinforced the fact that “no other individuals are permitted in the tent or locker room during an evaluation,” which was something both Daboll and Skattebo both violated during Jaxson Dart’s concussion evaluation. The Giants were at risk of losing a draft pick if found to be in violation, however, it appears the league will bypass removing draft picks in exchange for the fines levied against the teams and those directly involved with the incident.</description>
