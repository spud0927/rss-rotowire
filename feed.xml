      <title>Rashid Shaheed caught 1-of-3 targets for 51 yards in Seattle’s NFC Championship win over the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f863-d968-a19b-f8f3658d0000</link>
      <description>Sam Darnold dropped a 51-yard haymaker to Shaheed in the first quarter and his other two targets were incomplete but eventful. Cobie Durant knocked one of them out, and the other was a borderline uncalled DPI on the sideline late in the game. It’s hard to say that the Seahawks didn’t make the right move trading for Shaheed, but we’d love to see them actually integrate him more into the game plan than they have. Then again, hard to complain about much with that offense as things stand heading into Super Bowl LX.</description>

      <title>A.J. Barner caught 2-of-3 targets for 13 yards in Seattle’s NFC Championship win over the Rams.</title>

      <description>Barner hasn’t crossed 50 yards since Week 11 and is mostly a touchdown-or-bust tight end for fantasy purposes, plus or minus a few tush pushes a game. There’s certainly little reason to expect him to expand on that role in Super Bowl LX.</description>

      <title>Jake Bobo caught 1-of-2 targets for 17 yards and a touchdown in Seattle’s NFC Championship win over the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f867-dc7a-af9b-ffffbdd50000</link>
      <description>We haven’t blurbed a Jake Bobo game in all of 2025, as the third-year receiver had just two catches for 20 yards in the regular season. Little did we know it’d all be building to Honkin’ On Bobo in the NFC Championship game, as he scored following Xavier Smith’s disastrous punt flub while the entire Rams defense followed Jaxon Smith-Njigba across the field. It’d be hard to count on Bobo in Super Bowl LX DFS, but if he got there, it would be very funny.</description>

      <title>Puka Nacua caught 9-of-14 targets for 165 yards and a touchdown in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f86a-d968-a19b-f8fbbc730000</link>
      <description>Answering a taunting flag on Riq Woolen by immediately toasting him for a touchdown in the third quarter, Nacua continued his reign of terror against the Seahawks. It was, amazingly, his fifth game of the season and playoffs to go over 160 yards. He’ll enter next year as a surefire WR1 and almost undoubtedly one of the first three receivers off the board after his league-leading 129 catches for 1715 yards and 10 touchdowns. There is some fragility here in the sense that Matthew Stafford is (even more) old and Nacua takes a lot of punishment on the field, but it’s hard to bet against the No. 1 wideout in a Sean McVay offense not delivering the goods.</description>

      <title>Davante Adams caught 4-of-6 targets for 89 yards and a touchdown in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f870-dc7a-af9b-ffff16930000</link>
      <description>If the last two playoff weeks made it seem like Adams was having trouble getting reacquainted with Matthew Stafford after a long hamstring-related layoff, this game certainly made it feel like the connection was back. Adams hauled in a dart that was just shy of the goal line, then cashed in with a red zone out. Adams led the league in receiving touchdowns despite not playing the last three weeks of the season, which both says something about how good the McVay passing offense was and how bad league-wide offense was in 2025. He’ll remain a likely WR2 in 2026 even entering his age-34 season. It certainly didn’t seem like he was losing anything physically this year.</description>

      <title>Colby Parkinson caught 3-of-4 targets for 62 yards in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f875-d35e-a1bf-fdf709160000</link>
      <description>Parkinson’s touchdown run finally ran out of steam over the past two weeks, but he ends the year with 43/408/8 in the regular season and another score in the playoffs. He did drop a third-down pass in this one, but was otherwise what we’ve come to expect. It’s hard to imagine that the Rams will phase him out of the offense altogether in 2026, the final year of his contract, but teams will probably have better answers for Los Angeles’ 3TE sets with a year of tape to pick over and Terrance Ferguson will be a likely breakout candidate. It all adds up to Parkinson being more of a TE2 in 2026 offseason drafts.</description>

      <title>Davis Allen was not targeted in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f878-d968-a19b-f8f9d0570000</link>
      <description>Allen went untargeted in the playoffs despite a strong snap share — he’s clearly the blocking tight end of the four-headed 3TE attack the Rams run. He enters the final year of his rookie contract in 2026 looking like a solid use of a roster spot for the Rams and someone fantasy managers should never, ever call on.</description>

      <title>Terrance Ferguson did not catch either of his two targets in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f87a-d56e-afff-fefacdc40000</link>
      <description>It’s an unsatisfying end to a season that looked to be trending up over his last three games, with a hamstring injury sandwiched around games of four, four, and five targets heading into this one. Ferguson probably won’t garner much offseason hype given the fact that the Rams very easily fed Puka Nacua and Davante Adams this year, but he has a shot to take a major step forward. He’s best-drafted as a high-end TE2 given the Rams’ 3TE shenanigans and our lack of a proof of concept for a big fantasy game, but where there’s talent and a good offensive playcaller, fantasy points aren’t hard to foresee.</description>

      <title>Tyler Higbee caught his only target for 12 yards in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f87e-d56e-afff-fefeb8e10000</link>
      <description>A free agent this offseason, the 33-year-old tight end certainly didn’t earn many targets for the Rams in 2025 despite 3TE looks being the norm. Some of that is Davante Adams and Puka Nacua, yes. Some of that is also just getting old. We’d bet on Higbee to get sniffs in free agency, but we’d be surprised if the lifelong Ram found a fantasy-favorable role in 2026.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f87e-d56e-afff-fefeb8e10000</guid>

      <title>Konata Mumpfield failed to catch either of his two targets in Los Angeles’ NFC Championship loss to the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-f881-d35e-a1bf-fdc3ad0c0000</link>
      <description>Mumpfield had an eight-target game in Davante Adams’ hamstring-related absence and certainly appears to be the main backup wideout on the outside after the Rams picked him in the seventh round of last year’s draft. He finished the year with a 10/92/1 line. There’s not an obvious fantasy vacuum for him to step into even if he managed to be the main third receiver in 2026 — especially given how successful three tight-end looks were for the Rams this year. Still, he’s an interesting dynasty bench stash after making good progress in his rookie year.</description>
