      <title>Seahawks signed WR Brenden Rice to the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9944-d45b-affe-ddd66e370000</link>
      <description>Rice, the son of NFL Hall of Famer and former Seattle Seahawk Jerry Rice, was most recently on the Patriots’ practice squad. The Seahawks add him to their practice squad as depth to the pass-catching corps. The 23-year-old Rice appeared in three NFL games for the Chargers last season, but has not recorded a target on offense. The Seahawks also added RB Velus Jones to the practice squad.</description>

      <title>Panthers RB Chuba Hubbard said, “when I came back from my calf, I wasn’t maybe quite where I wanted to be.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9986-d45b-affe-dd9659a10000</link>
      <description>Hubbard missed two games due to a calf injury he suffered prior to Week 5. He has not been efficient since returning, losing his lead back role to Rico Dowdle and averaging under 4.0 yards per carry since Week 7. Via Kassidy Hill on the Panthers’ team website, Hubbard said he “maybe rushed it back a little sooner.” The 26-year-old was paid like the team’s lead back at the beginning of the season but the veteran Dowdle has outplayed him as Hubbard deals with his calf injury. For the rest of this season, Hubbard is an RB4 at best.</description>

      <title>Hearing officer Jordy Nelson upheld Bengals WR Ja’Marr Chase’s one-game suspension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9a13-d1e7-a1fa-dafb7b510000</link>
      <description>Nelson, jointly appointed by the NFL and NFLPA, upheld Chase’s one-game suspension. Chase appealed his suspension for spitting on Steelers DB Jalen Ramsey during the Bengals’ Week 11 loss. He argued he would have aimed for Ramsey’s face and not the jersey or ground if he meant to spit on Ramsey. Chase’s argument did not appeal to Jordy Nelson and the one-game suspension is upheld. He will miss Week 12 against the Patriots, losing a game check of$507,156as a result.</description>

      <title>Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer said he’s “very in favor” of signing WR George Pickens to a long-term deal.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9c50-d713-ad9e-fc54a7be0000</link>
      <description>Pickens is excelling during a prove-it year in Dallas after wearing out his welcome with the Steelers. Making about $3.6 million this season, Pickens will become a free agent in March. Pickens through Week 11 is second among all pass catchers in yards and tenth in receptions. He went for 144 yards and a score in Dallas’ Week 11 win over the hapless Raiders. “Sign me up. I mean, what do you say?” Schottenheimer said Tuesday when asked about Pickens staying in Dallas beyond 2025. “Those two guys [Pickens and CeeDee Lamb], I just love their relationship, man. I love the firepower that they give us. That’s one of those games where you never know which one it’s going to be. Some games it’s both of them. Some games it’s one of them, and again, like I said, I pinch myself at times.” As long as Pickens is seeing targets in a pass-first Cowboys offense, he’ll likely be content in Dallas.</description>

      <title>Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski said QB Shedeur Sanders will start in Week 12 against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9cd7-d673-a39e-bcd77bf20000</link>
      <description>Dillon Gabriel remains in the NFL’s concussion protocol after sustaining a head injury in Week 11 against the Ravens. Sanders, who relieved Gabriel against Baltimore and completed four of 16 pass attempts for 47 yards and an interception, will get the start against Vegas. Sanders averaged 2.9 yards per attempt and was 34 percent below his expected completion rate. It makes the Raiders defense a must-start option in 12-team leagues. None of the Cleveland pass catchers are priorities with Sanders under center. Jerry Jeudy is startable in 14-team leagues with multiple flex spots.</description>

      <title>Colts opened the 21-day practice window for CB Charvarius Ward (concussion).</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9cf7-d673-a39e-bcf7a0a70000</link>
      <description>Ward sustained a concussion during pre-game warmups ahead of the Colts’ Week 6 game against Arizona and was placed on injured reserve. He could suit up as soon as this week against the Chiefs if he clears the NFL’s concussion protocol and gets the green light from Colts trainers. Ward will be a welcome addition to a Colts secondary that has struggled of late.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s James Palmer reports Falcons QB Michael Penix sustained a partial ACL tear and is out for the remainder of the 2025 season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9cfd-d45b-affe-ddfff27b0000</link>
      <description>The Falcons’ season is all but over after injuries to Penix and Drake London (knee) in Week 11’s loss to the Panthers. Kirk Cousins will take over at quarterback and play out the rest of the season unless the Falcons bring in competition for starting snaps. Cousins, who ranks 45th out of 46 qualifying QBs in accuracy this season, is a big downgrade for all Atlanta pass catchers. A dormant passing attack isn’t good new for Bijan Robinson either as Falcons opponents are likely to stack the box with Cousins at the helm. Fantasy managers should downgrade all Falcons players for the final month and change of the fantasy season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Marvin Harrison, Jr. (appendicitis) has been ruled out for Week 12 against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9d02-d1e7-a1fa-dfea9cf50000</link>
      <description>That Harrison was ruled out so early in the week could mean he’s iffy for Week 13 as well. He missed Arizona’s Week 11 game against the 49ers after undergoing surgery for appendicitis. In stepped Michael Wilson, who had 15 receptions for 185 yards against the Niners — more catches and yards than MHJ has ever had in an NFL game. Wilson is a must-start fantasy play for as long as Harrison is sidelined. Harrison’s absence doesn’t mean much for Jacoby Brissett, who remains an interesting fantasy play in the pass-heavy Cardinals offense.</description>

      <title>Cardinals opened the 21-day practice window for RB Trey Benson (knee).</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-9d06-d45b-affe-dd9617600000</link>
      <description>Benson has been sidelined for five Cardinals games after sustaining a serious knee injury in early October, shortly after the team lost James Conner for the season. It’s hard to say what role Benson will return to if he’s able to suit up in Week 12 against the Jaguars, but he’ll likely split the backfield workload with some combination of Bam Knight and Michael Carter. Emari Demercado has been ruled out for Week 12 with an ankle injury he sustained last week. Benson shapes up as a decent flex option if he plays against Jacksonville.</description>
