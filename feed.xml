      <title>Colts QB Anthony Richardson’s agent said trust is “questionable” with the front office after Daniel Jones was named the starter.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c498-d332-a1fd-d6be4eb30000</link>
      <description>Richardson’s agent, Deiric Jackson, said he and the Colts “have a lot to discuss.” Indy just named Daniel Jones as the starting quarterback for 2025, leaving Richardson on the bench. The former No. 4 overall pick has dealt with his struggles and benching in the past and Jackson believes the Colts’ decisions have damaged the team’s credibility. Obviously an agent believes his client should be starting, but the Colts seem headed for an overhaul at the quarterback situation at the end of the season. Whether or not Richardson remains a Colts by 2026 will be in question moving forward.</description>

      <title>Broncos head coach Sean Payton praised WR Pat Bryant’s unselfishness and blocking in Tuesday press conference.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c4a7-db7b-a5dd-e4a711550000</link>
      <description>Bryant is a third-round rookie from Illinois who has displayed some flash in camp and preseason. Payton boldly compared the big wideout to Michael Thomas and called him “an unselfish player” for his blocking in last weekend’s preseason game against the Cardinals. The 22-year-old has posted six receptions for 91 yards in the preseason while competing to be a top-three pass-catching option. Payton’s praise is a vote of confidence in Bryant, who is worth a late-round flier in season-long fantasy formats.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Brooke Pryor reports Steelers DT Cameron Heyward returned to practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c4af-dbe3-a9bb-f4ff78e90000</link>
      <description>Heyward has been holding-in since training camp on August 7th. He is awaiting a new contract after an All-Pro season last year. The Steelers signed him to a two-year, $29 million deal last September, but that average annual value ranks outside the top-20 interior defensive lineman. Heyward is 36, but is still a game-wrecker in the middle of the Steelers’ defense. There is still not progress on a new deal, but Heyward is practiced in individual periods on Tuesday.</description>

      <title>Cowboys RB Jaydon Blue (ankle) returned to practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c4c2-db7b-a5dd-e4c6ac4e0000</link>
      <description>Blue has been out since suffering an ankle injury two weeks ago, but returned to practice Tuesday. The 21-year-old rookie is in line for passing down snaps, but Miles Sanders and Javonte Williams have stayed ahead of him while Blue has been injured. If he can continue to practice in pads this week, we may see Blue for the final preseason game against the Falcons.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports Jaguars WR/CB Travis Hunter (upper body) returned to practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c4e8-dbe3-a9bb-f4fbc0850000</link>
      <description>Wolfe says Hunter was a limited participant in practice, with the hope he will be a full participant for joint practices against the Dolphins. The two-way phenom was held out of last weekend’s preseason game against the Saints, but there is no concern for him in Week 1. Wolfe notably said Hunter will be the two-way star the Jaguars hoped, going “full-time on offense, ease in on defense.” Preseason usage and camp reports continue to show that Hunter will primarily be a wide receiver heading into the season with situational reps at corner. He is a high-end WR3 for fantasy purposes.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport expects Commanders RB Brian Robinson to not play for Washington in 2025.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c511-de13-afdc-c7db761b0000</link>
      <description>Rapoport adds the Commanders may take on salary to trade Robinson to get a draft pick in return. The team is expected to move on from the 26-year-old, who hit escalators in his contract to the point where the Commanders prefer their cheaper options over extending him. The fourth-year back has fallen out of favor after Jacory Croskey-Merritt’s rise in camp. The Commanders have begun to shop Robinson around, and he could be a cut candidate if they cannot find a trade partner.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports the Jets, 49ers, and Vikings are “monitoring the trade market for potential wide receiver additions.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c7a5-de13-afdc-c7efe5e20000</link>
      <description>All three teams would make sense as a landing spot for disgruntled Commanders WR Terry McLaurin, who has sat out Washington’s training camp and is reportedly unhappy with the lack of progress toward a new deal with the Commanders. The Vikings will be without Jordan Addison for the season’s first month, meaning Jalen Nailor will likely work as the team’s WR2. The Jets, meanwhile, have the league’s thinnest wide receiver room behind Garrett Wilson. The 49ers will be without Brandon Aiyuk for a while, and Jauan Jennings is reportedly dealing with a calf injury and unhappy with his current contract. McLaurin’s fantasy stock would be highest in Washington, though San Francisco would be a good landing spot statistically for the 30-year-old wideout. He’d take a major hit if he’s dealt to the Jets.</description>

      <title>The Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan M. Alexander reports Joe Mixon (ankle, foot) could land on the PUP list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c7b1-de13-afdc-c7fb190e0000</link>
      <description>That would mean Mixon, dealing with lingering foot and ankle issues, would miss at least the first four weeks of the regular season. Mixon is already an iffy option for Week 1. He hasn’t been seen out at practice, nor has he worked off to the side, which would indicate he’s not two to three weeks away from returning from the foot or ankle injury he suffered off the field this past offseason,” Alexander said of Mixon, who rushed for 1,016 yards and 11 touchdowns over 14 games in 2024. Texans officials have been vague about Mixon’s status two weeks ahead of the team’s Week 1 game against the Rams. “Joe is kind of working through it,” general manager Nick Caserio said Tuesday. “We’ll kind of take it one day at a time. Once we get a little closer, we’ll probably have a better idea of where he’s going to be. But Joe is working hard trying to get himself back ready to go.” Nick Chubb, according to Alexander, “will likely serve as the lead back until Mixon returns, whenever that may be.” Chubb would probably share the backfield workload with Dameon Pierce and pass-catching specialist Woody Marks.</description>

      <title>The Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan M. Alexander believes Nick Chubb will “likely” work as the Texans’ lead back if Joe Mixon (foot, ankle) misses time in 2025.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c7ba-de13-afdc-c7fb34380000</link>
      <description>Alexander said the Texans signed Chubb this offseason specifically because they feared Mixon would miss time with a foot/ankle injury he suffered this offseason. Though Mixon is unlikely to miss the entire regular season, the veteran could land on the PUP list to start the season, according to Alexander. That would cost Mixon the first four weeks of the regular season and perhaps put Chubb in the RB1 role. One of the most inefficient rushers in the NFL last season, Chubb, 29, had 25 yards on five rushing attempts last week against the Panthers in the Texans’ second preseason matchup. Rookie Woody Marks led the backfield with 40 yards on seven carries. Marks would likely work as the primary pass-catching back if Mixon were to miss time, while Chubb splits early down duties with Dameon Pierce. Chubb will be touchdown dependent even as the team’s de facto No. 1 back.</description>
