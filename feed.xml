      <title>Panthers placed RG Brady Christensen (Achilles) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3563-d1e7-a1fa-7feb2afa0000</link>
      <description>Christensen suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in Week 8. He underwent surgery earlier this week. Christensen will hit free agency at the age of 29 after this season. The Panthers signed Mike White to their 53-man roster in a corresponding move. White could serve as Bryce Young’s backup this week with Andy Dalton banged up.</description>

      <title>Cardinals designated EDGE BJ Ojulari (knee) to return from the PUP list.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3603-d45b-affe-779739200000</link>
      <description>Ojulari suffered a torn ACL early in training camp last year. He began the 2025 season on the PUP list and is now eligible to return. By opening his practice window, the Cardinals have three weeks to officially activate him from PUP. Defensive tackle Walter Nolen has also been designated to return, meaning the Cardinals could be getting multiple upgrades on defense over the next few weeks.</description>

      <title>Texans WR Nico Collins (concussion) is “back for another practice and is expected to clear protocol if all goes well today.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-321e-d4ed-a9de-779e31ca0000</link>
      <description>Collins practiced in a limited capacity on Wednesday. Given this morning’s report, Collins was likely in phase three of the NFL’s five-phase concussion protocol. Should he respond positively to phase four activities today, he could pass through phase five, the clearance phase, quickly. Setbacks remain possible, but as of Thursday, Collins appears to be on track for a return in Week 9 against the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Texans TE Dalton Schultz (knee/shoulder) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-31f4-d4ed-a9de-77fed0930000</link>
      <description>Schultz has now missed Week 9’s first two practices, though head coach DeMeco Ryans said “he expects him to return later this week,” per NBC Houston’s Aaron Wilson. Ostensibly, that means tomorrow. Schultz is firmly in the questionable camp, though, and would seemingly play at less than 100.0 percent if active on Sunday. He would be tough to trust if he cannot practice in full tomorrow.</description>

      <title>Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon told reporters he is “preparing” QB Kyler Murray (foot) to start in Week 9 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3632-d713-ad9e-7e76478c0000</link>
      <description>The Cardinals face the Cowboys on Monday night. Murray remained limited through Week 7 practices and the team was on bye in Week 8. We expect Murray to practice in full today, given Gannon’s comments. Expect an update if that is not the case. The Cowboys’ defense has functioned as a matchup to target for fantasy quarterbacks this season, though concerns over Murray’s poor play are warranted. The Cardinals’ quarterback has finished as the QB16 in 4-of-5 games. Assuming he practices in full this week, he can be treated as a volatile starter in single-quarterback leagues.</description>

      <title>Bengals EDGE Trey Hendrickson (hip) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-363f-d1e7-a1fa-7effb01a0000</link>
      <description>Hendrickson and LB Logan Wilson (calf) were both sidelined on Thursday. Hendrickson continues to be the subject of trade rumors, though the Bengals have reportedly rebuffed inquiries thus far. Conversely, Wilson asked to be traded after losing his job as a defensive starter and was instead tasked with special teams duties, during which hereportedlyinjured his calf. The Bengals face the Bears in Week 9.</description>

      <title>Bengals QB Joe Flacco (right shoulder) was seen practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3645-d713-ad9e-7e55c70c0000</link>
      <description>Flacco’s participation level is currently unknown, but his return is a good sign for his Week 9 availability. The Bengals obviously hope to have Flacco under center against the Bears, rather than No. 3 QB Jake Browning, but throwing-shoulder injuries are, of course, finicky. Hopefully, Flacco can practice in full without setback by the end of the week.</description>

      <title>Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-364d-d713-ad9e-7e5db4540000</link>
      <description>These updates are largely formalities, with Pacheco already having been deemed “week-to-week” as he recovers from a sprained MCL. His practice status must be monitored all the same, though. Fantasy managers should expect RB Kareem Hunt to function as the team’s primary rusher, particularly in scoring position, while rookie RB Brashard Smith continues operating as a featured receiver and change-of-pace rusher. The Chiefs also have RB Elijah Mitchell stashed in the No. 4 role. Keeping him in mind is worthwhile, though he is not expected to have a role on game day at this time.</description>

      <title>Lions OC John Morton said “I failed him” when asked about Jameson Williams’ production this season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3668-d1e7-a1fa-7eeada9d0000</link>
      <description>“I looked at everything, as far as that. I’m going to do a better job with that. But there has been opportunities where it just didn’t happen. ... It’s not like we aren’t going to try to target him. So that was the biggest thing. ... So I looked at everything, and I failed him. That’s what I told him. I have to do a better job with that. But it’s a two-way street. We definitely looked at that,” is the full quote from Morton. Morton gassed up Williams this offseason. It does seem like there is some room for Williams’ opportunity to move beyond go routes in this offense, and perhaps that’s something that will happen out of the bye. Either way, this is a squeaky wheel update for Williams, who is toting a rough 17/289/2 receiving line through Week 8.</description>

      <title>Colts WR Josh Downs (hip) returned to practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-366f-d1e7-a1fa-7eeffa480000</link>
      <description>It will likely be a limited session, but this is a good step for Downs to be active against the Steelers this week. Downs has mostly been a thorn in fantasy football’s side, keeping the Colts from consolidating their secondary targets between himself and Alec Pierce. If he makes it to Friday healthy again, he’ll be a FLEX play in a good matchup against a Steelers defense that has surrendered plenty of passing yards this year.</description>
