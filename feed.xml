      <title>Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones “hinted” that RB Jaydon Blue could see some snaps against the Giants in Week 18.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70aa-dc7a-af9b-ffbf92b30000</link>
      <description>While the Cowboys have insisted that they’re playing their starters in Week 18, nothing in that guarantee says they’ll play most of the game. Javonte Williams (shoulder) left Week 17’s win over the Commanders, and Malik Davis is apparently also dealing with an eye injury. It’s possible that both start or get a limited runway and the Cowboys see what Blue can do, making Blue a Week 18 running back of interest. The fifth-round rookie hasn’t had a real role since October after a fumble against the Broncos.</description>

      <title>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he is “more optimistic than I have been in recent weeks” about LB T.J. Watt (lung) playing in Week 18.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70ad-d56e-afff-f6ed6e480000</link>
      <description>That’s not to necessarily Watt has a good chance given the reporting we’ve already had that he’s a long shot, and the qualifier “in recent weeks” is holding up the optimism. We think Watt has a chance to play, but he’ll probably have to start practicing in full by Thursday for Tomlin to confidently plug him in for the AFC North championship on Sunday night.</description>

      <title>NBC’s Aaron Wilson believes the Texans could “toll [Joe Mixon’s] contract, get rid of the contract.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70d8-d968-a19b-78f9a0c10000</link>
      <description>Per Wilson, Mixon “got some procedures on his own, away from the Texans, not from the Texans medical personnel, and it apparently affected the foot, the blood flow, and progress turned into a stall.” The major takeaway is Wilson saying that “the reason there’s so much mystery about this is because Joe Mixon prefers it that way ... there was electromagnetic therapy that was done to try to reduce inflammation in the foot.” The easy outside assumption has been that the Texans will simply release Mixon after the season. It would be interesting to see if there were grievances if they did decide to toll his contract — the Texans did pay Mixon his full salary this year rather than coming after it. This update at least opens the door that Mixon could return to the Texans in 2026. Wilson repeated that Mixon will not return in the 2025 season, including the playoffs.</description>

      <title>Panthers RB Rico Dowdle (toe) did not practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70ef-dc7a-af9b-ffff38940000</link>
      <description>Panthers coach Dave Canales said he is “pretty confident” that Dowdle will be good to go on Saturday afternoon. It has not been uncommon for Dowdle to get an early practice off this year, so we don’t have much reason to worry about his status for Week 18’s NFC South showdown just yet.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Josh Weinfuss believes there’s “an outside chance” a new Cardinals regime would keep Kyler Murray.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70f3-d35e-a1bf-75f34d710000</link>
      <description>In other words: If both GM Monti Ossenfort and head coach Jonathan Gannon get fired, Cardinals ownership will leave the quarterback decision up to their new braintrust. Most rumors that we’ve seen leading up to Black Monday have had Ossenfort safe — he’d probably bring back Jacoby Brissett on the second year of a two-year deal and then draft a quarterback to either push or develop behind Brissett. But given how disappointing the Cardinals have been en route to falling from 2-0 to 3-13, we shouldn’t be surprised if Ossenfort doesn’t survive.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers T Tristan Wirfs (toe) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-70f9-dc7a-af9b-ffff8a0d0000</link>
      <description>So much for him re-appearing! In all honestly this isn’t a big deal, and the fact that reporters mistook him for practicing is probably still a good sign for his chances of suiting up in Week 18’s must-win against the Panthers. Most veteran offensive linemen are allowed to play with little practice, and as long as Wirfs finds the field on Wednesday or Thursday he should be considered likely to go.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield (shoulder/knee) was limited in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-710d-d968-a19b-79fd13270000</link>
      <description>Mayfield has been listed with a left shoulder injury previously, but pops up here with a right shoulder listing from the Buccaneers. We don’t doubt that Mayfield will play. We also don’t doubt that he’s clearly playing through injury at this point, as he has struggled since leaving Tampa’s Week 12 game against the Rams at halftime. Over his past five appearances he has just a 63 percent completion rate, 216.8 yards per game, and seven touchdowns against five interceptions.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers CB Jamel Dean (shoulder) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7110-dc7a-af9b-ffbf33be0000</link>
      <description>Dean has been by far Tampa’s best cornerback this year, producing a 76.9 PFF coverage rating. It would be a big loss if he wasn’t able to go against the Panthers on Saturday. Dean left Week 17’s loss to the Dolphins in the third quarter and did not return.</description>

      <title>Packers placed DL Jordon Riley (Achilles) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7119-dc7a-af9b-ffbf08820000</link>
      <description>They also sent CB Kamal Hadden to IR after both Hadden and Riley suffered season-ending injuries against the Ravens in Week 17. Both players are at risk of missing time in training camp, if not spending time on the PUP list during the regular season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported the Browns and Raiders have done “preliminary research” on a coaching change.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7165-d968-a19b-79f5782b0000</link>
      <description>What exactly that entails, Fowler doesn’t actually get into, but he says “those are two places I see as like — they’ve done their preliminary research for a potential move, doesn’t mean they’re likely to do it or that they’ve decided yet.” We blurbed yesterday that Ian Rapoport doubts the Raiders will keep Pete Carroll. It sure sounds like the Browns and Stefanski should also be on the radar for a firing (or potentially a trade) once Week 18 unfolds. Stefanski gave up playcalling to Tommy Rees in early November and was reportedly less than thrilled when the Browns traded Joe Flacco to the Bengals. If the Browns did move on from Stefanski, he would be a strong candidate to pick up a new head coaching gig this offseason after twice winning the AP Coach of the Year award in 2020 and 2023.</description>
