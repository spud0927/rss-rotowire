      <title>Dolphins signed WR Cedrick Wilson off the Saints practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9bf9-d6e9-af9d-9bf96d750000</link>
      <description>Wilson is no target threat at this stage of his career, which is good news for Jaylen Waddle, Malik Washington, and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine. Those three appear to be a the top of the pecking order in a post-Tyreek Hill Dolphins offense. Westbrook-Ikhine played the majority of the outside snaps in Hill’s absence in Week 4.</description>

      <title>Browns placed WR Cedric Tillman (hamstring) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9c05-dca3-a9fb-bd9d9cfa0000</link>
      <description>They signed Malachi Corley and Gage Larvadain to the active roster to replace Tillman. Isaiah Bond out-targeted Tillman 10-5 the past two weeks and would seem to be the main beneficiary of a Tillman absence, though it’s hard to want to start him into the Vikings given how poorly Joe Flacco has played this year. Tillman will be out at least four weeks and might not return to a spot in Cleveland’s pecking order. He’s droppable in most leagues.</description>

      <title>Raiders LT Kolton Miller (ankle) will be placed on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9c09-deb6-a7fd-dfdfb40e0000</link>
      <description>It’s not just a high-ankle sprain, but additionally a hairline fracture per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. It sounds like this will knock Miller out for most, if not all of the season. Miller played through the injury in Week 4, but posted a disastrous 43.2 PFF grade while doing so. Third-round pick Charles Grant and veteran Stone Forsythe are the current depth options in the Raiders tackle room.</description>

      <title>Bills placed P Cameron Johnston (leg) on injured reserve.</title>

      <description>The punter will miss at least the next four weeks after replacing Brad Robbins as Buffalo punter in Week 1. Buffalo’s third punter of the season will be Mitch Wishnowsky. You can do what you will with that information.</description>

      <title>Panthers coach Dave Canales said that Chuba Hubbard’s calf injury “wasn’t a factor” in how reps were divided in Week 4.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9c13-d6e9-af9d-9e934d400000</link>
      <description>Canales told reporters that he believes “with the players we have in the backfield, if we can sustain drives, if we can play these games that way, then we have a full-speed runner, a violent runner in every time.” That’s a rough quote for Hubbard’s future workload — something that Athletic beat writer Joseph Person is advocating should grow. It doesn’t feel like the coaching staff feels the same way. Rico Dowdle probably doesn’t qualify as a bye week FLEX play just yet, but this quote certainly at least puts him into consideration in deeper leagues.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Joe Person reports David Moore (elbow) “likely will miss multiple weeks.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9c16-d95b-addb-fc56851c0000</link>
      <description>Rookie sixth-rounder Jimmy Horn — you may remember him as Travis Hunter’s Colorado teammate — will get a chance to ply his trade in Moore’s absence, with Dave Canales saying he wants to “make sure he’s able to go out there and give us significant reps. We’ll carve out a role because there’s certainly things he can bring to our offense with his speed and ability to carry the ball and make yards.” Horn could make an interesting pickup in deeper leagues right now with Hunter Renfrow not exactly blossoming last week.</description>

      <title>Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Devonte Wyatt (knee) is “week to week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9c1d-dca3-a9fb-bd9d8a640000</link>
      <description>Wyatt’s injury appeared to be a big factor in Green Bay’s trouble stopping Dallas on Sunday night. Nazir Stackhouse and Karl Brooks filled in inside, but neither is as effective as the 2022 first-rounder had been in the first few games of the year.</description>

      <title>49ers QB Brock Purdy (toe) did not practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9c2c-d95b-addb-fc6eb34d0000</link>
      <description>Most importantly, when asked about Purdy, Shanahan said he’d play “if we feel he can play up to 100 percent of his ability.” Purdy looked shaky and was sailing some balls against the Jaguars in Week 4’s return. Mac Jones could be in line for another start against the Rams in Week 5. We already learned that Purdy would be questionable earlier this morning from John Lynch, but this is a discouraging sign for his chances of being active.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Ricky Pearsall (knee) did not practice Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9c69-dca3-a9fb-bdf9bb080000</link>
      <description>After saying that he felt some instability in his knee following Sunday’s loss, we’re not surprised to see Pearsall not practicing today. John Lynch said earlier this morning that he’d be on the questionable line for Week 5. We’d ultimately be very surprised if he played.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (shoulder/ankle/ribs) did not practice on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9c6b-d6e9-af9d-9efb1b820000</link>
      <description>Jennings seems very unlikely to go on Thursday against the Rams, but has not yet been officially ruled out. If Jennings and Ricky Pearsall are both out, this passing game could go almost exclusively through Christian McCaffrey in Week 5.</description>
