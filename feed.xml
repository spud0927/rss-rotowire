      <title>The Athletic’s Matt Barrows believes the trade market for Mac Jones will be “robust” and “there’s a good chance they’ll get an offer they can’t refuse.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48e5-d629-a1bc-f8fd914f0000</link>
      <description>Barrows concludes by saying he thinks the 49ers could get a second-round pick for Jones, or perhaps a third-round pick and a sweetener. While we don’t doubt that the 49ers think their team stability is worth a lot at quarterback — and we’ve heard both national reporters and Kyle Shanahan say recently that they don’t think they’ll move on from Jones — at some point the 49ers need to embrace the fact that they rehabbed his value from nothing and could likely do so again with a different quarterback. Given how thirsty things might get on the quarterback streets this year, we concur with Barrows that there’s a real chance Jones goes for a Day 2 pick.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Ryan McFadden believes Alec Pierce and Rashid Shaheed are players the Raiders “could target” in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48e9-d629-a1bc-f8fde9410000</link>
      <description>Part of the offensive overhaul under Klint Kubiak will be to figure out how to fix last year’s wideout room, which ended the season with Tre Tucker and a dusty Tyler Lockett getting the majority of the snaps. Franchise-tagging Pierce could be in play for the Colts. Kubiak just spent half a season with Shaheed, so that pairing has some extra juice. (Though it should be noted Shaheed didn’t exactly thrive on offense with Kubiak.)</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Joe Buscaglia believes Dawson Knox is a candidate to be released.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48f8-d042-afbc-7dfa058a0000</link>
      <description>The Bills would save $9.6 million in cap space with a release of the veteran tight end, and Jaxson Hawes played well enough in his rookie season to believe he could step into a featured role as the No. 1 blocking tight end. Given how deep the Bills are in cap hell — they project to be over the cap by $7 million before the offseason starts — lopping off Knox definitely is in play at this point. Buscaglia also projects Curtis Samuel ($6.05 million in cap savings) and Ty Johnson ($2.45 million) as potential candidates for release as the Bills look to get cap compliant.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zac Jackson believes Shedeur Sanders will get “runway to be the No. 1 quarterback for the summer and early fall.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4909-d042-afbc-7ddb17c90000</link>
      <description>To be clear, this doesn’t mean that Sanders is the long-term starter for the Browns — in fact, Jackson even says they’re probably looking at drafting another quarterback “fairly early” in this year’s draft. But it seems like the team is mostly playing its cards as if they’re getting ready for 2027, not 2026, with Deshaun Watson as “a fallback option because he has to be.” That should give Shedeur Sanders a chance to start in 2026 — he’ll need to do better than he did towards the end of 2025 to keep the job, however, incredibly funny Pro Bowl nod aside.</description>

      <title>Jets hired former Browns quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave as their quarterbacks coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4915-d89c-a1be-efdf639a0000</link>
      <description>Musgrave has coordinator experience with the Panthers, Jaguars, Vikings, Raiders, and Broncos. The 58-year-old has not called NFL plays since 2018 and has spent the last three years with the Browns. He’ll be another voice in Frank Reich’s room as the Jets try to turn their offense away from the abyss.</description>

      <title>Raiders coach Klint Kubiak said he wants EDGE Maxx Crosby “to be a part of our success going forward, there’s no doubt about that.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4919-d89c-a1be-efdf5cd00000</link>
      <description>This is mostly cold water on the idea of a Crosby trade from the team’s new head coach, but we’ll see what happens going forward here. There have been too many reports of Crosby wanting out — including one of him telling Tom Brady he’d never play for the Raiders again — to fully invest in the idea that a trade won’t happen. Still, it’s broadly good news that Crosby was at the introductory presser and had coffee with Kubiak.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Josh Kendall believes franchise-tagging Kyle Pitts “makes the most sense” for the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-492d-d89c-a1be-efffc9dc0000</link>
      <description>Kendall notes that he believes Pitts is “likely to remain in Atlanta” either way, but that with the new executives and head coaches mostly not commenting on him, it would give everyone a year involved to see how good Pitts can be in Kevin Stefanski’s offense. The franchise tag for tight ends is not exorbitant, and Kendall notes that Pitts’ agent would likely ask for at least the tag (a little over $16.3 million) in average annual value anyway.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Josh Kendall believes Drake London “could get a new deal this offseason.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4931-d355-a5bd-cf75ec0c0000</link>
      <description>Kendall notes that new GM Ian Cunningham proactively gave an extension to DJ Moore in Chicago, and writes that “getting the deals done sooner rather than later should be the team’s approach.” London enters 2026 on his fifth-year option and is scheduled to make $16.8 million. An extension would obviously make plenty of sense after London established himself as one of the best receivers in the NFL over the past two seasons despite inconsistent quarterback play. Kendall believes London “likely sees himself” as a $30 million a year player.</description>

      <title>Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza said he’s a “huge fan” of Klint Kubiak.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-493f-d042-afbc-7dffcd540000</link>
      <description>“Throughout this entire season, we actually had a little bit of a Kubiak-[Sean] McVay system, not for our RPO system but our play-action,” Mendoza told reporters in San Francisco during Super Bowl week. “The way [Kubiak] is able to incorporate outside zone and get the edge with the run game, where the running back can collect the edge, hit the hole or cut back and do play-action off of that, and the way he has developed Sam Darnold has been phenomenal,” Mendoza noted. Not that we needed a whole lot of convincing that this would eventually happen, but it sure sounds like Mendoza is excited by his likely fate to be a Raider with the No. 1 overall pick.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers OC Zac Robinson said he sees Bucky Irving “in a very similar light [to Bijan Robinson] there with what he can do in the passing game.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4943-d89c-a1be-efdfcf720000</link>
      <description>“There’s not a run concept that he can’t run,” Robinson said. It was certainly a disappointing 2025 season between injury and an inability to stick on the field in the red zone, but Irving appears to be entering 2026 as the lead back for an offensive coordinator who believes in him. And with Rachaad White a free agent, to boot, it seems likely that Irving is primed for a 2026 rebound.</description>
