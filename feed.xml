      <title>ESPN’s Jordan Raanan reports that Giants QB Jaxson Dart (concussion) did not suffer any setbacks this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a8b7-d90e-a9da-bfbff1590000</link>
      <description>Per Raanan, the decision to hold Dart out for another week “was made by the doctors to play it safe with the young quarterback.” Good for them. Bad for the fantasy managers who had hoped to start him this week. Aside from saying Dart is “feeling better,” Raanan has not yet reported whether Dart is still experiencing symptoms. That part remains unclear. Hopefully, he returns for the team’s Week 13 matchup with the Patriots. The Giants notably go on bye in Week 14.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Mike Silver and Dianna Russini report that the 49ers voided WR Brandon Aiyuk’s 2026 contract guarantees and “appear headed toward a stunning divorce.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a8b8-db57-afda-febacc970000</link>
      <description>According to sources, it is likely that Aiyuk “has played his last game with the franchise,” though “some in the organization are holding out hope.” Aiyuk has reportedly “failed to attend meetings and declined to participate in other team activities.” Frustrated by Aiyuk’s lack of communication, the 49ers responded by voiding his 2026 guarantees, “asserting that the absences amounted to a failure to fulfill his contractual obligations.” Aiyuk reportedly told NFLPA reps “that he did not want to fight the move via an official grievance,” which “would clear the way for his expected release at season’s end.” The move allows the 49ers to recoup a significant sum. Aiyuk’s 2026 option bonus would have paid out $24.935 million. Silver and Russini’s report details unresolved issues between Aiyuk and the 49ers’ brass, dating back to the 2023 season. The star wide receiver was very nearly traded to the Steelers in August 2024, but ultimately agreed to sign the 49ers’ standing offer. The deal, unfortunately, failed to mend the damaged relationships. While Aiyuk would surely draw interest as a free agent, unknowns remain regarding Aiyuk’s health. The veteran wide receiver has not played since tearing his ACL, MCL and meniscus in October 2024.</description>

      <title>Travis Kelce told reporters that he “plans to decide on whether to return to the Chiefs by early March, before NFL free agency begins.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a8f1-d82c-a79a-bbf5696c0000</link>
      <description>Kelce is currently in his 13th NFL season and is scheduled to enter free agency at the end of the year. The veteran tight end said he will not be making any decisions about his future until after the 2025 season concludes, and intends to give the Chiefs the “opportunity” to prepare for the draft and free agency with his decision in mind. Stay tuned.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports that the Browns built the game plan for Week 12 against the Raiders around QB Shedeur Sanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-a91e-d413-ad9f-bddfb3310000</link>
      <description>The game plan will reportedly let Sanders “move the pocket a little bit more and use that play-making ability.” Wolfe also said the coaching staff has been helping Sanders work on his arm angles and reads, while trying to keep his footwork from drifting. The broadcast played lowlight clips of Sanders repeatedly failing to evade the Ravens’ pass rush last week as the segment progressed. Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski is a capable quarterback developer, but reworking Sanders’ bad habits over the course of a week is a tall task, especially with a matchup against Raiders EDGE Maxx Crosby looming. If Stefanski really does feature Sanders, as opposed to employing a run-heavy approach featuring RB Quinshon Judkins, we should get a read on Sanders’ development fairly quickly.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Bengals QB Joe Burrow won’t be activated for Week 12’s matchup with the Patriots.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-aa05-db57-afda-fe3752d80000</link>
      <description>Burrow practiced all week and was even taking first-team reps by the end of the week. Still, the Bengals are making the call to hold him out for one more game with a short week coming up, leaving Joe Flacco to make another start against the Patriots in Week 12. Burrow, who will remain on injured reserve, appears to be on track to return from a toe injury that’s kept him out since Week 2 in Week 13 against the Ravens on Thanksgiving Day.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports Buccaneers WR Chris Godwin (fibula) is expected to play in Week 12’s matchup with the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ac1d-d82c-a79a-bf9d3ab60000</link>
      <description>Russini’s report comes on the heels of Bucs coach Todd Bowles admitting that Godwin was trending towards playing as of Friday. The 29-year-old wide receiver was mostly limited in practice this week. Godwin is a desperation FLEX play for fantasy managers given the difficult matchup with the Rams on Sunday Night Football on NBC. If Godwin can return to form before the fantasy playoffs, he could turn out to be one of the better players to stash this year.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Bears CB Jaylon Johnson (groin) won’t be activated for Week 12 against the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-aca5-d413-ad9f-bdfd44540000</link>
      <description>Johnson and Kyler Gordon (hamstring) are both listed as questionable, but Fowler reports neither will be activated from injured reserve to face the Steelers in Week 12. Fowler passes along that the team is hopeful both can return in Week 13 against Philadelphia. Both cornerbacks were placed on injured reserve after suffering injuries in training camp.</description>

      <title>Eagles removed C Cam Jurgens (concussion) from the injury report ahead of Week 12 against the Cowboys.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-acbe-d90e-a9da-bfbf56870000</link>
      <description>Jurgens departed the team’s Week 11 win over the Lions to be evaluated for a concussion. He increased his participation in each practice this week before drawing the questionable tag, ultimately removed from the injury report Saturday ahead of a matchup with the Cowboys.</description>

      <title>Titans elevated WR Xavier Restrepo from the practice squad for Week 12 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-acc2-d82c-a79a-bfd69f1f0000</link>
      <description>Quarterback Cam Ward’s former collegiate teammate was elevated to the active roster for the first time since signing to the team’s practice squad before the start of the season. Injuries to Calvin Ridley and Elic Ayomanor made it necessary for the team to bring up pass-catching depth, and Restrepo made the most sense. It remains to be seen how much run he will get in his first professional contest.</description>

      <title>Bears placed LB Tremaine Edmunds (groin) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-aced-d413-ad9f-bdfdf5e20000</link>
      <description>Edmunds will miss the next four games, at minimum, leaving a gaping hole in the interior of the Chicago defense. Fellow linebacker T.J. Edwards was also ruled out for Week 12, boosting the rushing matchup for Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell for the Steelers.</description>
