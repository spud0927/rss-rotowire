      <title>Breece Hall (knee) was seen participating in individual drills during Thursday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0e8c-d8cf-affb-beaed1400000</link>
      <description>This will likely go down as a limited session for Hall. That is a step in the right direction after the team held him out of Wednesday’s practice entirely. This is likely just maintenance for a workhorse back who has been dealing with a knee issue for over a month. Hall should be good to go by Sunday, though the absence of Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor could tank the Jets’ offense. Brady Cook appears to be in line to start versus the Jags. The Jets will undoubtedly ride Hall, keeping him in the RB2 ranks even if the offensive environment is a disaster.</description>

      <title>Texans RB Woody Marks (knee) resumed practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0e93-d77b-adfb-ce931d210000</link>
      <description>Outstanding. The Texans’ featured rookie running back, once viewed as simply a pass-catching specialist, is tentatively on track to play in Week 15 against the Cardinals. Marks’ 84 touches over the last four weeks tie for the position’s fourth-largest workload during that span. He should handle another hefty workload with Chubb (ribs) on the wrong side of questionable.</description>

      <title>Texans RB Nick Chubb (ribs) was not seen practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0e9e-da9b-a9bf-de9f31c40000</link>
      <description>Chubb is now on the wrong side of questionable for the Texans’ Week 15 game against the Cardinals. The veteran running back was forced from his team’s Week 14 victory over the Chiefs on Sunday night after injuring his ribs. Rookie running back Woody Marks (knee) should be viewed as a borderline RB1/2 at this time.</description>

      <title>Bills TE Dawson Knox (personal) resumed practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0ea6-d77b-adfb-cea790f90000</link>
      <description>Knox should be good to go for the Bills’ Week 15 game against the Patriots. He is not worth starting in re-draft formats, though he warrants minimal consideration in DFS, given the expectedly fantasy-friendly game environment.</description>

      <title>Colts designated DT DeForest Buckner (neck) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0eb1-d77b-adfb-ceb3c1d70000</link>
      <description>The Colts officially opened Buckner’s 21-day practice window on Wednesday. He kicked the week off with a limited session and continued practicing today, though his participation level is unknown. The talented defensive tackle was placed on injured reserve in November after suffering a herniated disc in his neck that was pressing on a nerve, resulting in a loss of strength on the left side of his body.</description>

      <title>Ravens QB Lamar Jackson resumed practicing on Thursday after resting on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0ebc-d77b-adfb-cebf95e80000</link>
      <description>Last week, Jackson banked his first QB1 finish since Week 9. He gets an extra soft matchup against the Bengals’ fantasy-friendly defense in Week 15, giving him strong odds of repeating the once-routine feat. This is a must-win game for both teams. The Ravens (6-7) and Bengals (4-9) are still attempting to claw their way toward a playoff spot.</description>

      <title>Cardinals WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel) was not seen practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0ec4-da9b-a9bf-decdd1500000</link>
      <description>Assuming Harrison is officially listed as a non-participant on the team’s injury report later today, Thursday marks his fifth straight heel-related absence. He seems highly unlikely to play at this point, preserving WR Michael Wilson and TE Trey McBride’s elite workloads. Check back tomorrow to see if Harrison can return to practice, but in the meantime, make backup plans.</description>

      <title>Bengals WR Tee Higgins (concussion) was seen practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0eca-d005-a9bf-defe10fe0000</link>
      <description>Higgins was seen wearing pads while going through warmups, which is a good sign for his Week 15 availability. He was “very limited” yesterday, and that could be the case today, but his continued participation is encouraging. The Bengals have a must-win game against the division-rival Ravens this weekend.</description>

      <title>Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb (concussion) was seen practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0ee6-d8cf-affb-beeeb41c0000</link>
      <description>Lamb was a limited participant on Wednesday. We do not yet know his participation level today, but his continued activity is a good sign. The Cowboys’ No. 1 wide receiver suffered a concussion in last week’s Thursday Night Football game. The extra time off could help him clear the NFL’s concussion protocol without missing any time.</description>

      <title>Steelers WR DK Metcalf (stomach) was seen practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-0edd-d005-a9bf-defd7bdb0000</link>
      <description>Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin told reporters on Tuesday that Metcalf should be able to play in the team’s Monday Night Football game against the Dolphins this week, but there was a chance Metcalf could miss practice time. Instead, Metcalf took the field for the week’s first practice. Expect him to play on Monday night.</description>
