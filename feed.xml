      <title>Raiders will interview Seahawks QB coach Andrew Janocko for their offensive coordinator vacancy today.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-62ff-d89c-a1be-efffe7820000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Adam Schefter notes that Janocko is also a candidate for the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator vacancy. Janocko and new Raiders head coach Klint Kubiak have worked together for years. Janocko served as the Vikings, Saints and Seahawks’ quarterbacks coach while Kubiak concurrently held each team’s offensive coordinator role. Schefter’s colleague, Jeremy Fowler, said last week that he believes Janocko is a “natural candidate” to be the Raiders’ offensive coordinator under Kubiak.</description>

      <title>Seahawks hired 49ers run game coordinator Brian Fleury as their new offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6326-d89c-a1be-efff19fd0000</link>
      <description>This has the feel of a heat-check hire for the Seahawks, who bring on someone who has never called offensive plays before and only has a single season as a run game coordinator with San Francisco in 2025. The process didn’t exactly yield a ton of “easy” candidates — it was a down year for offensive coaches and many of them had been picked over while Seattle was busy winning a championship. Still, we have very little that says Fleury is qualified for this job from the outside beyond “was a close Kyle Shanahan personal circle friend.” Despite winning Super Bowl LX, the Seahawks’ run game struggled at times last season. Fleury’s hiring may bode positively for the run game’s outlook in 2026. ESPN’s Brady Henderson previously reported that the Seahawks’ new offensive coordinator will call plays this season.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports that the Raiders are expected to hire Seahawks QB coach Andrew Janocko as their new offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-634e-d355-a5bd-ef5e9c860000</link>
      <description>Pelissero adds that Janocko is in Las Vegas right now and a deal “should get done as soon as today.” This hiring makes sense. Janocko is close with new Raiders head coach Klint Kubiak, having served as quarterbacks coach with the Vikings, Saints and Seahawks while Kubiak was simultaneously employed as each team’s offensive coordinator. Kubiak will continue calling plays offensively, though this is still a step up for Janocko.</description>

      <title>Browns LB coach Jason Tarver is one of the three finalists for Cleveland’s defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6391-d629-a1bc-f39dfe510000</link>
      <description>The Cleveland Plain-Dealer’s Mary Kay Cabot identified Texans defensive pass game coordinator Cory Undlin and Falcons defensive pass game coordinator Mike Rutenberg as the other two finalists earlier today. Tarver has been in his current role since 2020. Cabot believes new Browns head coach Todd Monken could hire the team’s new defensive coordinator by Monday or Tuesday.</description>

      <title>Raiders hired Matt Robinson as their new secondary coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6394-d629-a1bc-f39d81d10000</link>
      <description>Robinson followed new Giants head coach John Harbaugh from the Ravens to New York this offseason. ESPN’s Adam Schefter notes that the Giants support Robinson’s decision to take a new opportunity elsewhere despite recently filling an open role in Harbaugh’s new staff. Robinson coached the Ravens’ outside linebackers last season. He previously worked with new Raiders DC Rob Leonard in Baltimore in 2022.</description>

      <title>NFL insider Jordan Schultz reports the Dolphins will release LB Bradley Chubb.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-66de-d629-a1bc-f6df0f5b0000</link>
      <description>Chubb was acquired by the Dolphins at the 2022 trade deadline and signed him to a five-year extension the following offseason. The veteran pass-rusher started all 17 games in 2025 after missing the 2024 season due to a torn (ACL), racking up 47 tackles, 8.5 sacks, and eight TFLs in his return to the field. Chubb will be 30 at the start of next season and should still have plenty to offer any teams in need of help at getting after the quarterback. Chubb’s release will likely be designated as a post June 1 release, which will allow the team to split his dead cap hit over the next two seasons rather than take on an amount just north of $23.5 million this season. Chubb is now free to sign with any team.</description>

      <title>Dolphins released OG James Daniels.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-66f2-d89c-a1be-efff33af0000</link>
      <description>Daniels signed a three-year, $24 million contract with the Dolphins last offseason but appeared in just one game due to a pectoral injury. The eight-year vet has played in just five games over the last two seasons, but has 85 games of starting experience under his belt. If he can get healthy for 2026, Daniels could have some value as a low-cost addition for several teams on what will likely be a prove-it deal next season.</description>

      <title>Dolphins released WR Tyreek Hill.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6748-d990-a1de-6f4e45f30000</link>
      <description>Hill is one of several Dolphins players who have been informed of their release. The soon-to-be 32-year-old receiver saw his 2025 season come to an end in Week 4 when he suffered a dislocated knee and torn ACL against the Jets, but put together a respectable 21-265-1 line before going down. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero notes “it’s unclear when or if” Hill will play next season, but if he does, Hill will be a free agent for the first time in his career. The eight-time Pro Bowler should have plenty of suitors once he can prove he’s fully recovered from his injury.</description>

      <title>Dolphins released WR Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-674c-d89c-a1be-efdfc62b0000</link>
      <description>Westbrook-Ikhine caught 11 passes for 89 scoreless yards in his lone season with the Dolphins. The 28-year-old vet joined the team fresh off a 32-497-9 season with the Titans, but will now be free to sign with any team. Westbrook-Ikhine’s value as a field stretcher should be enough to find him a new home in 2026, but he’s unlikely to ever be a focal point of whatever offense he’s in.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-674c-d89c-a1be-efdfc62b0000</guid>

      <title>NFL insider Jordan Schultz reports the Dolphins don’t want their decision to move on from Tua Tagovailoa “to drag too long.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6755-d89c-a1be-efdfec600000</link>
      <description>This report comes on the heels of the Dolphins making several cost-cutting moves to their roster on Presidents’ Day. As Schultz notes, the team would prefer to trade Tagovailoa, but “a cut is possible in the end” if they are unable to find a suitor. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported last week that the Dolphins are willing to take on a portion of Tagovailoa’s contract to trade him to another team, but given the $54 million he’s guaranteed to earn this season, the team may be forced to release him and designated him as a post-June 1 cut. Tagovailoa threw for 2,660-20-15 in 14 games last season, struggling to adjust to life without Tyreek Hill (knee) who was injured in Week 4. While he could still be a serviceable starter in the right system, he’ll need to turn in a strong performance next season if he hopes to prove he can be a franchise QB elsewhere.</description>
