      <title>Mike Gesicki caught 2-of-4 targets for 19 yards in the Bengals’ Week 13 win over the Ravens.</title>

      <description>Gesicki was the leader of a tight-end-by-committee in Week 13. Tanner Hudson, Drew Sample, and Noah Fant all caught one pass on two targets. Hudson’s only grab was a toe-tapping touchdown from 14 yards out. Tee Higgins was out with a concussion this week, but Geiscki did little to earn more work if Higgins misses another game. He will barely be on the TE2 radar even if Higgins remains out for Week 14 versus the Bills.</description>

      <title>Derrick Henry rushed 10 times for 60 yards and a touchdown in the Ravens’ Week 13 loss to the Bengals, adding one catch for 44 yards.</title>

      <description>For fantasy managers, it’s a shame the Ravens couldn’t keep this game close, because The Big Dog was ready to feast on Thanksgiving. He got things going early with a 28-yard score on Baltimore’s opening drive. That was about it for his night. The Ravens quickly spiraled out of control on the back of five turnovers, making it impossible for the Ravens to establish a ground game as they played from behind. Henry still made his presence known by turning a routine check-down into a 44-yard catch at the end of the third quarter, but the game script turned a potential blow-up spot into a usable floor week from the stud back. The good news is that the Ravens get the Steelers at home next week. Henry will keep his spot in the RB1 ranks as the Ravens look to course-correct in Week 14.</description>

      <title>Keaton Mitchell rushed two times for 19 yards and a touchdown in the Ravens’ Week 13 loss to the Bengals, adding two catches for 12 yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-c8f8-db57-afda-defa8a0f0000</link>
      <description>Mitchell rewarded fantasy managers bold enough to start him with an 18-yard touchdown sprint late in the third quarter. Those fantasy managers should likely take their chips off the table after this game. Even with Justice Hill out this week, Mitchell split the backup duties with Rasheen Ali. Ali easily out-snapped Mitchell and saw four carries, though three of them came on the team’s final drive. Despite scoring in Week 13, Mitchell isn’t really on the FLEX radar heading into a Week 14 matchup with the Steelers.</description>

      <title>Isaiah Likely caught 5-of-6 targets for 95 yards in the Ravens’ Week 13 loss to the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-c8fc-db57-afda-defe87780000</link>
      <description>Likely led the Ravens in all receiving categories. He set a season-high in receiving yards and put 38 yards between himself and the team’s No. 2 pass-catcher, Mark Andrews. Likely broke chunk plays seemingly at will, gashing the Bengals for gains of 43 and 30 yards in this game. All of his hard work, however, was undone by one costly mistake. On his 43-yard catch and run, Likely fought his way toward the end zone, only to cough up the ball inches short of the goal line. The ball went out of bounds in the end zone, resulting in a turnover. The Ravens didn’t go away from Likely after this, but it’s still a frustrating play from a player who hasn’t found his stride this year. Still splitting work with Mark Andrews, Likely will be stuck in the TE2 ranks for Week 14.</description>

      <title>Mark Andrews caught 4-of-6 targets for 47 yards in the Ravens’ Week 13 loss to the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-c901-d82c-a79a-fb95bd750000</link>
      <description>Andrew tied Isaiah Likely for second on the team in targets. The two tight ends each earned 19 percent target shares. Andrews ran more routes and was used as a check-down option, while Likely saw more downfield work, resulting in a team-high 95 yards from the explosive tight end. Neither player can be declared the team’s clear TE1 and the Ravens are struggling on offense as Lamar Jackson nurses various injuries. Andrews will hold the edge in the fantasy rankings next week, though both tight ends will sit outside the top 12 options versus Pittsburgh.</description>

      <title>Rashod Bateman failed to catch his only target in the Ravens’ Week 13 loss to the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-c906-d82c-a79a-fb9687d10000</link>
      <description>Bateman made his return from the high-ankle sprain that cost him two games. He ran plenty of routes, but Lamar Jackson barely noticed him, throwing just one pass his way. He should get more involved next week as he continues to put distance between himself and the ankle issue, but fantasy managers cannot trust him until they see some production. He will sit somewhere in the WR5/6 ranks for Week 14 versus the Steelers.</description>

      <title>Zay Flowers caught 2-of-7 targets for six yards in the Ravens’ Week 13 loss to the Bengals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-c909-d90e-a9da-df0f3d2c0000</link>
      <description>The good news is that Flowers’ seven targets led the team. He logged a 22 percent target share. The bad news? Everything else. The Ravens tried to get Flowers going downfield, but he and Lamar Jackson were seemingly never on the same page. The two-time MVP regularly sailed passes to Flowers and was visibly frustrated with the situation late in the game. To top things off, Flowers coughed up a fumble late in the fourth quarter, putting to rest any hope of a Baltimore comeback. Better days should be ahead for the young wideout, but he was looking like a potential WR1 a month into the season. Now he is fighting for a spot in the WR2 ranks heading into Week 14 versus Pittsburgh.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports Amon-Ra St. Brown is believed to have suffered a low ankle sprain in Week 13’s loss to the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-ca9c-db57-afda-debe0b850000</link>
      <description>The team will continue to evaluate ARSB’s injury, but the hope is that St. Brown, who isn’t believed to be a candidate for injured reserve, won’t miss more than 1-2 weeks. The Lions’ schedule is such that they have just one game over the next 16 days, meaning a two-week recovery period could result in just one missed game. It’s far too early to say when we could see him on the field next, but given how the injury looked on the field, it’s safe to say this is pretty good news. We’ll likely get a better sense of where things stand in the coming days.</description>

      <title>Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel said Darren Waller (pectoral) is “in play” to return in Week 13 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb5a-d82c-a79a-fbde69930000</link>
      <description>McDaniel noted that whether Waller returns to face the Saints will depend partly on how Friday’s practice goes. Waller has been listed as limited in both practices to start this week, creating cautious optimism that he could be activated this week. Waller has played in four games this season and scored in three of those games. The veteran tight end would have some high-end TE2 upside if he were to be activate this week. We’ll check back in on his availability when the Dolphins release Friday’s injury report.</description>

      <title>Trey Benson (knee) will not play in Week 13 against the Buccaneers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-cb60-db57-afda-df7206930000</link>
      <description>Benson was ruled out before the team took the field for Friday’s practice. The second-year back was a limited participant to start the week, but listed as a DNP on Thursday. He appeared to be trending toward a return after being limited in every practice ahead of Week 12’s game, so it’s possible we’re looking at a setback here. This remains a situation to monitor, but for now, we can expect the duo of Bam Knight and Michael Carter to lead the Cards’ backfield against the Buccaneers.</description>
