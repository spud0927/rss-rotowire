      <title>Case Keenum is considered day-to-day with a leg injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-aed3-df63-a199-fffb56f40000</link>
      <description>The injury could cost Keenum his shot at earning the Bears’ No. 2 quarterback job. He currently sits behind fellow backup QB Tyson Bagent, and backup snaps will be harder to come by this weekend, with the starters slated to get some work early on against the Bills. Details on Keenum’s leg injury, suffered yesterday, have not yet been released. He spent the 2024 season on injured reserve with a foot injury.</description>

      <title>Colts EDGE Samson Ebukam left Thursday’s practice early after suffering a back injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-aefa-df63-a199-fffbe9c20000</link>
      <description>Ebukam spent the 2024 season on injured reserve after rupturing his Achilles tendon in training camp. The Colts have not yet provided an update on his back injury. Ebukam posted career highs in tackles (34), quarterback pressures (48) and sacks (10) in his first season with the Colts, back in 2023.</description>

      <title>49ers released TE Ross Dwelley.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-af86-df63-a199-ffaf47240000</link>
      <description>Dwelley has evidently lost the battle for the 49ers’ No. 3 tight end role. Dwelley spent the first six seasons of his career with the 49ers before venturing to Atlanta for a one-off season with the Falcons last year. He re-signed with the 49ers in May. He turned 30 in January. The 49ers correspondingly signed DT Shakel Brown, with three of their defensive linemen currently working through injuries.</description>

      <title>Rashee Rice “has received clearance to travel with the team and be permitted to enter Brazil” for the Chiefs’ Week 1 game against the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-afbb-d90d-a5bd-affb72810000</link>
      <description>Rice pleaded guilty to a pair of felonies in relation to a multi-car crash last month. Per the Washington Post’s Mark Maske, “there had been questions among some familiar with the case” whether Brazil’s immigration policies would complicate Rice’s entry into the country. The Chiefs’ No. 1 wide receiver is good to go.</description>

      <title>NBC Sports Houston’s Aaron Wilson reports, Joe Mixon (foot, ankle) “is not considered a lock to be ready for” the Texans’ Week 1 game against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-af8e-d90d-a5bd-afdf0ca30000</link>
      <description>Wilson adds that “the Texans will take their time with managing his recovery and will not rush him back onto the field.” Mixon missed the entire offseason and remains out indefinitely, weeks into Texans training camp. Earlier today, Texans OC Nick Caley praised Dameon Pierce for his physical, violent playing style. Observing the backfield rotation in the Texans’ preseason Week 2 game against the Vikings tomorrow will be worthwhile for fantasy managers. In the same report, Wilson quotes Texans owner Cal McNair waxing poetic about his love of old school football: Playing tight defense and fielding a good rushing attack. The Texans’ backfield will be fantasy-relevant in Week 1, whether Mixon is active or inactive.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports that Kirk Cousins is “finally healthy again and has impressed in training camp.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-afdf-d45c-a7fc-afdfa8d50000</link>
      <description>Cousins dealt with a throwing arm injury in-season last year, but in the video segment, Pelissero curiously references Cousins’ 2023 Achilles tendon rupture, with regard to Cousins’ current health. The comment seemingly acknowledges that Cousins’ ability to plant and drive off of his surgically repaired right leg was compromised last year. The good news is Cousins’ zip has apparently returned. Pelissero names the Rams as a potential trade partner, given Matthew Stafford’s back injury and Cousins’ familiarity with head coach Sean McVay’s scheme via Falcons’ OC Zac Robinson, McVay’s former understudy. Cousins will not play in the Falcons’ preseason Week 2 game against the Titans tonight.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports that “there is still a possibility” for the NFL and Rashee Rice to “agree to a settlement on a suspension, that would allow Rice to be suspended at the start of the season.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-afe2-d05a-adda-afe2a0950000</link>
      <description>Per Pelissero, the NFL initially proposed a suspension lasting 10-plus games. Rice’s representatives argued for a far shorter suspension, in part because “there is no precedent for suspending someone for over half of the season.” With the two sides reaching an impasse, it was determined Rice’s case would be presented before Judge Sue L. Robinson, which could put Rice’s late-season availability at risk. Losing Rice early in the year would sting as well, with high-profile opponents like the Chargers, Eagles and Ravens on tap in Weeks 1-4. Both the team and the league are incentivized to get this issue sorted out as quickly as possible.</description>

      <title>The Browns are “cautiously optimistic” that Shedeur Sanders (oblique) can return to practice next week and play in the team’s preseason Week 3 game against the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b01b-df63-a199-f93b0a5f0000</link>
      <description>Sanders will not play in the Browns’ preseason Week 2 game against the Eagles tomorrow. Kenny Pickett is rehabbing a hamstring injury and will not play either, though the team is “hoping” that Dillon Gabriel will “wake up feeling good enough” to play on Saturday, after rehabbing a hamstring injury of his own this week. Tyler Huntley will take most reps, if not. Joe Flacco has been bubble-wrapped as the lone healthy, proven player in the room.</description>

      <title>Cam Ward completed 2-of-7 passes for 42 yards in the Titans’ preseason Week 2 game against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b01a-d90d-a5bd-b25bc2d20000</link>
      <description>Ward played three drives in this one, and his arm strength was evident despite the lackluster results. Among the Titans’ expected Week 1 receiving corps, only Chig Okonkwo and Van Jefferson Jr. joined Ward on the field. Neither player earned a target. Ward instead focused on honing his connection with fellow rookie, WR Elic Ayomanor, who caught 2-of-4 targets thrown to him by Ward for 37 yards. Ayomanor is unlikely to be re-draft-relevant this year but he should be rostered in dynasty.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zac Jackson reports that Browns TE Harold Fannin Jr. is “absolutely going to be involved in the offense.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b041-d45c-a7fc-b25bce180000</link>
      <description>Jackson’s commentary is particularly noteworthy. Back in June, he believed Fannin was “considered more of a long-term project than an immediate contributor.” Jackson now believes the rookie tight end “is ahead of schedule, even if Stefanski won’t directly say it.” Fannin is “going to line up all over the formation,” which fits with his usage at Bowling Green State. Jackson counted Fannin, along with Joe Flacco and Jerry Jeudy, as players whose stock is rising. He counts “the rest of the pass-catching group” among those whose stock is down. Many things must fall Fannin’s way before he can be considered truly re-draft-relevant, but early returns suggest the Browns successfully drafted a capable contributor in Round 3 this year.</description>
