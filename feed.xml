      <title>Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said he’s hoping Christian Darrisaw (knee) “is back at some point.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23b5-d005-a9bf-fbb5b1990000</link>
      <description>He called it both a “week-to-week” and “day-to-day” situation. Darrisaw was active for Week 14, but missed Week 13 and Week 15 while spending very little time at practice. With the Vikings officially eliminated, it doesn’t make much sense for him to gut this out. We expect Minnesota to shut him down unless his health improves.</description>

      <title>Commanders coach Dan Quinn said LT Laremy Tunsil (oblique) will play Saturday “if he can.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23c9-d8cf-affb-bfebcfb30000</link>
      <description>“We’ll have to see what the strength looks like for him -- the movement, the strength -- over these next couple days,” he said. The star left tackle left Washington’s win over the Giants in Week 15. Tunsil has had his best season in years per PFF, with an 84.7 overall offensive grade while cutting his penalties from 19 last year to eight in 2025. The Commanders, 4-10, have not lived up to their part of the bargain with Tunsil, and with nothing to play for, don’t have a reason to push him out there in Week 16 if he’s not healthy.</description>

      <title>Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said he’s “exhausting all options to see” if LT Charles Cross (hamstring) can play in Week 16.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23ce-d005-a9bf-fbfe482a0000</link>
      <description>Seattle will host the Rams in a pivotal NFC West clash that will put the winner in the driver’s seat for homefield. Cross hurt his hamstring on Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal. Based on this update, he almost undoubtedly will not be listed as a participant on Monday’s estimated practice report. Josh Jones is the healthy depth option at tackle for Seattle.</description>

      <title>Bears designated LB Tremaine Edmunds (groin) for return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23d3-d77b-adfb-ebd357dc0000</link>
      <description>Edmunds was placed on injured reserve after suffering a groin injury in Week 12. With his 21-day window now opened, the Bears can activate him to the 53-man roster at any time. Edmunds has totaled 89 tackles, four interceptions, and one sack for the Bears this season and should be back in time to boost their defense by the playoffs.</description>

      <title>Bears coach Ben Johnson said Luther Burden (ankle) is a “day-by-day” situation.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23dc-d8cf-affb-bffe42c40000</link>
      <description>Burden’s availability for Saturday night’s game against the Packers seems to be in some question by this update. We’ll start getting practice reports for that game on Tuesday. It wouldn’t be surprising if Burden wasn’t ready for a short week after leaving Week 15’s game in the third quarter and not returning, but the practice report will give us more of an idea of where he’s at.</description>

      <title>Bills HC Sean McDermott said Matt Prater (quad) will not play in Week 16 against the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23dd-d1bc-a3fb-a7fdac170000</link>
      <description>The Bills will also be without DT Jordan Phillips. Prater suffered a quad injury in the Bills’ Week 15 win over the Patriots and will miss at least one game with the injury. He was already filling in this season for Tyler Bass (hip/groin), which means the Bills will be in search of their third kicker heading into this weekend’s game against the Browns. The Bills don’t currently have a kicker on their practice squad, so they’ll have to try out a handful of guys this week.</description>

      <title>Bears coach Ben Johnson said “all options are on the table” when asked about Rome Odunze (foot) and intimated they may need to “protect him from himself.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23df-d8cf-affb-bfff28a80000</link>
      <description>The full quote from Johnson was: “There may be a case that we need to protect him from himself a little bit so he can help us down the road.” It doesn’t sound like he’s especially likely to be ready to go against the Packers in Week 16. And the idea of a shut down possibly being in play should have Odunze-reliant managers (assuming they survived last week’s bagel) making other plans for the remainder of the fantasy playoffs.</description>

      <title>Patriots waived LB Caleb Murphy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23e9-d005-a9bf-fbfda2760000</link>
      <description>The Patriots claimed Murphy off waivers from the Chargers in October. The 26-year-old linebacker totaled just two tackles in the five games he appeared in for the Patriots and became expendable after the team signed Chad Muma earlier on Monday. Murphy will now head back to waivers where he can be claimed by any team.</description>

      <title>Jets placed S Isaiah Oliver (knee) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23ed-d8cf-affb-bfefc0b30000</link>
      <description>Oliver’s season will come to an end with this IR designation. The eighth-year safety has appeared in 14 games for the Jets this season, totaling 55 tackles and three pass breakups while also making two starts. Oliver earned a 49.1 PFF coverage grade this season and spent some time in the slot. He signed a one-year contract with the Jets this offseason and will likely enter free agency next offseason.</description>

      <title>Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said EDGE Jonathan Greenard (shoulder) will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-23fd-d8cf-affb-bfff2d1c0000</link>
      <description>Greenard will be a candidate for an offseason extension/restructure with a $22.3 million cap hit and the Vikings entering the offseason over the cap. Greenard finishes his age-28 season with just three sacks after back-to-back seasons of 12.5 and 12 in 2023 and 2024, but the Vikings simply didn’t force as many pass-rush situations in 2025 as the defense struggled to contain the run. He was trying to play through his shoulder injury, but with the Vikings officially out of the playoff picture, Greenard can recuperate ahead of the 2026 season.</description>
