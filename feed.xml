      <title>Texans QB C.J. Stroud (concussion) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7e60-d1e7-a1fa-7eea1b460000</link>
      <description>NBC Houston’s Aaron Wilson notes that Stroud is still experiencing concussion-related symptoms. Backup QB Davis Mills is getting ready to start for the second straight game in Week 11 against the Titans. The Texans could end up with a run-heavy game script here, so Mills may not be needed to engineer another improbably good showing, though the Titans’ defense certainly could provide him with opportunities to make plays.</description>

      <title>Texans TE Dalton Schultz (shoulder) was not seen practicing on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7e6c-d713-ad9e-7e7c756b0000</link>
      <description>Two weeks ago, Schultz sat out during Wednesday and Thursday’s practices before practicing in full on Friday and suiting up on Sunday. The 29-year-old tight end is clearly banged up, but he knows the offense and can play on game day without participating much during the practice week. Schultz’s target share could take a hit if second-year tight end Cade Stover (foot) returns from injured reserve this week, though. Stover was limited on Wednesday.</description>

      <title>Giants signed WR Isaiah Hodgins, formerly of the Steelers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7e71-d45b-affe-7ff79cd30000</link>
      <description>This is GM Joe Schoen’s third time bringing Hodgins aboard one of his teams, having first been part of the Bills’ front office that drafted Hodgins in the 2020 NFL Draft’s sixth round. Schoen later plucked Hodgins off waivers in 2022, after Schoen had vacated the Bills’ assistant general manager role for the Giants’ general manager role earlier in the year. Hodgins has toiled away on the Steelers’ practice squad this season. He has never cracked 400 yards in a single season, but at times served as a capable intermediate-depth clasher. Given the state of the Giants’ wide receiver corps, Hodgins could work his way into a starting role at some point, though he cannot be started in 12-team leagues at this time. He is a name to know moving forward.</description>

      <title>Ravens QB Lamar Jackson (knee soreness) returned to practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7e70-d673-a39e-fef1780a0000</link>
      <description>Jackson is back. Per ESPN’s Jamison Hensley, the Ravens’ quarterback “moved around well during media viewing and looks set to start Sunday at Browns.” Playing through knee soreness against the Browns’ top-tier defense is unideal, but Jackson remains in the high-end QB1 ranks thanks to his elite dual-threat talents.</description>

      <title>Patriots RB TreVeyon Henderson (knee) “once again is expected to assume a larger workload” with RB Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) ruled out.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7e8c-d45b-affe-7f9eb5980000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Mike Reiss notes that “the only other running back on the roster is former practice squad player Terrell Jennings” (knee), who is questionable to play this evening. The Patriots will likely elevate veteran RB D’Ernest Johnson “from the practice squad for the third straight week,” and also re-signed RB Jonathan Ward to the practice squad on Tuesday, making him an elevation option alongside rookie RB Rushawn Baker. Henderson was limited by a knee injury on Monday but successfully upgraded to full participation on Tuesday and does not carry a game designation. He should handle a borderline RB1/2-level workload, and possesses the explosive traits required to finish squarely in the RB1 pool this week.</description>

      <title>Eagles C Cam Jurgens (knee) practiced on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7eb7-d673-a39e-feb77cfa0000</link>
      <description>He also participated in a walkthrough yesterday. Jurgens’ return to the lineup would help solidify an interior line that feels like it hasn’t all been healthy at the same time all season. Jurgens has missed the last three weeks since leaving Week 7 with the injury.</description>

      <title>NBC’s Aaron Wilson reports K Matthew Wright is “preparing to kick again” in Week 11.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7ebd-d673-a39e-febd6a830000</link>
      <description>Kaimi Fairbairn will miss another week with his quad ailment. Wright makes for an interesting streaming option against the lowly Titans, especially given how much the Texans have struggled in the red zone this year.</description>

      <title>Commanders designated DE Drake Jackson (knee) to return from injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7eaf-d45b-affe-7fbfb74b0000</link>
      <description>The Commanders now get a 21-day window to observe Jackson in practice before officially having him join the active roster. The 24-year-old defensive end has suffered two season-ending knee injuries. The most recent one, which he is currently recovering from, was a torn patellar tendon suffered in 2023. The former second-round pick could boost the Commanders’ pass rush if his surgically repaired knee is good to go.</description>

      <title>Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said C.J. Stroud (concussion) will not play in Houston’s Week 11 game against the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7ec4-d45b-affe-7fd662970000</link>
      <description>Given the timing of this and the fact that Stroud has not practiced at all since being concussed against the Broncos in Week 9, we’re starting to wonder if Stroud will be able to turn it around for Thursday night’s game against the Bills in Week 12. Stroud is still reportedly experiencing concussion-related symptoms. Davis Mills will be under center against the Titans in Week 11. It’s possible he gets yet another start in Week 12 as well.</description>

      <title>Texans QB Davis Mills will start in Week 11 against the Titans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-7eb1-d713-ad9e-7ef5aace0000</link>
      <description>Texans QB C.J. Stroud (concussion) has officially been ruled out despite one practice remaining this week. Stroud reportedly remains symptomatic after suffering a concussion in Week 9 and has not yet returned to practice. Mills amazingly finished as the overall QB3 in Week 3 against the Jaguars, scoring three touchdowns, including one on the ground. He is unlikely to repeat the feat again, though the Titans’ soft defense should allow him to play efficiently. He is a QB2.</description>
