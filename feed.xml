      <title>Cowboys HC Brian Schottenheimer said DaRon Bland (foot) is “trending to play” in Week 4 against the Packers.</title>

      <description>Bland has missed the last two games due to a foot injury he suffered in Week 1, but the fourth-year corner could be on the field in a pivotal Week 4 matchup against a tough Packers team. Bland avoided being placed on injured reserve after going down in the season-opener, so a return within four weeks was always on the table. The Cowboys will release their first injury report of the week on Wednesday. Bland’s name will be one to keep an eye on.</description>

      <title>Cardinals HC Jonathan Gannon confirmed James Conner will undergo season-ending surgery.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-735d-d1b3-a5dd-737d07990000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported late last night that Conner “did in fact suffer a season-ending injury,” but Gannon officially confirmed things on Monday. The veteran running back suffered a devastating ankle injury that required him to be carted from the field and will undergo surgery soon. Conner, 30, remains under contract with the Cardinals through the 2026 season and will turn 31 in March.</description>

      <title>Seahawks signed RB Khalil Herbert to the practice squad.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7370-dfde-a1bd-7ffdf8bd0000</link>
      <description>Herbert worked out for the Commanders after being released by the Colts at roster cuts this offseason, now catching on with the Seahawks. Whether his signing is correlated to the injury to Zach Charbonnet remains to be seen.</description>

      <title>Cowboys G Tyler Booker (ankle) will miss 4-6 weeks with a high-ankle sprain.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7374-d6a5-adff-f7f59bcb0000</link>
      <description>The Cowboys are now with two-thirds of the interior of their offensive line as Booker joins center Cooper Beebe on the sideline with multi-week injuries. Both Booker and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb emerged from the team’s Week 3 loss to the Bears with high-ankle sprains, making it that much more difficult to claw their way out of a 1-2 start to the season.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan said he expects QB Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder) to practice this week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-738c-d1b3-a5dd-73fd28280000</link>
      <description>Purdy has missed the previous two games with toe and shoulder issues, leaving Mac Jones to start in his absence. Jones reportedly aggravated a PCL injury in Week 3, something that could push Purdy to return at less than full strength ahead of a meeting with the 2-1 Jaguars. Fantasy managers will want to monitor his practice statuses throughout the week.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Falcons fired WR coach Ike Hilliard.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-7395-d6a5-adff-f7d59cbe0000</link>
      <description>Passing game coordinator T.J. Yates will be given additional responsibilities as he now takes over the wide receiver coach duties. Hilliard was hired before the 2024 season but made it just over a season before being let go. His departure comes in the wake of a 30-0 loss to the reeling Panthers in Week 3.</description>

      <title>Lions declared S Thomas Harper, RB Craig Reynolds, OL Kingsley Equakun, DL Chris Smith, and DL Mekhi Wingo inactive for Week 3 against the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-739a-d93f-ad9d-7bdf8ce30000</link>
      <description>No real surprises here as the Lions enter Week 3 as one of the healthier teams in the league. They will have their hands full against the 1-1 Ravens on Monday Night Football.</description>

      <title>Ravens declared RB Keaton Mitchell, CB Jaire Alexander, OT Carson Vinson, DT Nnamdi Madubuike, OLB Kyle Van Noy, TE Isaiah Likely, and FB Patrick Ricard.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-739d-d1b3-a5dd-73fdcf5a0000</link>
      <description>The Ravens have been bitten hard by the injury bug to start the season, with at least five regular starters watching from the sidelines against a tenacious Lions team. Alexander, Madubuike, and Van Noy are particularly massive absences in each level of the defense.</description>

      <title>Cardinals HC Jonathan Gannon said WR Zay Jones is in the concussion protocol.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-73a0-dfde-a1bd-7fad4e160000</link>
      <description>Gannon added that the injury occurred on the team’s last offensive play of the game in their Week 3 loss to the 49ers. Jones has played around 50 percent of the offensive snaps in each of the first three games this season. Any missed time could provide more run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.</description>

      <title>Seahawks RB Zach Charbonnet (foot) was listed as a full participant on the team’s estimated practice report Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-73b0-d93f-ad9d-7bf74d810000</link>
      <description>The Seahawks did not hold a practice Monday as they prepare to face the Cardinals on a short week, but the team’s listing of Charbonnet as a full participant is nonetheless striking after he missed Week 3 with a foot injury. Kenneth Walker managed just 53 percent of the team’s offensive snaps in the Week 3 win, the size of which can likely be explained by the extremely positive game script the Seahawks found themselves in against the Saints. It will be interesting to see how the snap and opportunity rates shake out should Charbonnet return to the lineup on Thursday Night Football.</description>
