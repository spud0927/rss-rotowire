      <title>Olamide Zaccheaus caught 1-of-2 targets for nine yards in the Bears’ Divisional round loss to the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d49b-dc7a-af9b-dfbf15da0000</link>
      <description>Zaccheaus signed a one-year deal with the Bears this offseason and wound up being a thorn in the side of Luther Burden’s fantasy managers for the first half of the season. The veteran receiver occupied his normal role in the slot early in the year, but later saw more work on the outside. Zaccheaus caught 39 passes for 313 yards and two touchdowns in the regular season, and finished the year with the third most routes run (335) of any Bears receiver, per PFF. Whether he’s back with the Bears in 2026 or playing elsewhere, Zaccheaus seems destined to play out the rest of his career on one-year deals and will likely ink another deal similar to his current one this offseason.</description>

      <title>Colston Loveland caught 4-of-10 targets for 56 yards in the Bears’ Divisional round loss to the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d4a0-d968-a19b-dcf16d8e0000</link>
      <description>It took a while for things to start paying off for the Bears, who selected Loveland with the No. 10 overall pick in this year’s draft. Despite a slow start out of the gate that resulted in just 116 scoreless receiving yards through the first eight weeks of the season, Loveland broke out in the second half for 47-597-6 over the final 10 games of the regular season, and went off for 8-137-0 on 15 targets in the Bears’ Wild Card win over the Packers. Loveland was the first tight end taken off the board in this year’s draft and appears to be on the fast track to being one of the best the league has to offer. His strong finish to the season will set the expectations for 2026 extremely high in both the real world and for fantasy managers. He’ll be on a short list for elite tight ends to consider drafting next season and could come at a premium as hype around his sophomore season grows.</description>

      <title>Cole Kmet caught 3-of-3 targets for 31 yards and a touchdown in the Bears’ Divisional round loss to the Rams.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d4a6-dc7a-af9b-dfbfdad00000</link>
      <description>Kmet found himself on the receiving end of a miraculous fourth-down throw by Caleb Williams to keep the Bears’ season alive with 18 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Kmet’s score would force the game into overtime, but the Bears came up short in the extra frame after the Rams made the most of a Caleb Williams interception on the Bears’ only drive. Kmet’s numbers have now fallen off in back-to-back years. After going for 73-719-6 in 2023, the sixth-year vet saw his fewest targets (45), receptions (30), and receiving yards (347) since his rookie year this season, and found the end zone just twice. As far as his work as a pass-catcher is concerned, Kmet took a backseat to rookie Colston Loveland this season, and now looks expendable heading into this offseason despite signing a four-year contract extension in 2023. Per OverTheCap, the Bears can release Kmet for a dead cap hit of just $3.2 million if the team makes him a pre-June 1 cut. A post-June 1 cut would carry a $1.6 million dead cap hit. Kmet will turn 27 next season and could have plenty to offer another team as a starter should he become available.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver is expected to have a second interview with the Steelers this week for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d65b-d968-a19b-defbc31e0000</link>
      <description>Weaver is also reportedly being targeted by new Giants head coach John Harbaugh to fill his defensive coordinator vacancy, but the long-time coach will continue to field interviews for head-coaching openings for the time being. Weaver has already met with the Ravens for their head-coaching vacancy, but the Steelers are the first time interested in giving him a second look. Weaver’s name has floated around a future head coach for the last several seasons. His Dolphins regressed in 2025 after finishing as a top-10 defensive unit the previous season, but with seven head coaching jobs still on the table, it wouldn’t be surprising if Weaver landed his first gig this offseason.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports former Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel will interview with the Raiders on Monday for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d65d-dc7a-af9b-dfff4eb20000</link>
      <description>As far as head coaching vacancies are concerned, McDaniel now has second interviews with both the Browns and Raiders lined up for this week, and he still remains a highly sought-after offensive coordinator for other teams. Regardless of where he lands, the former Dolphins head coach won’t be without a job for long, as several suitors have emerged since his firing at the end of the season.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Raiders will have a second interview with Chargers DC Jesse Minter for their head-coaching vacancy on Tuesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d65f-dc7a-af9b-dfffc79b0000</link>
      <description>Minter is already scheduled to meet with the Browns for a second time and can now add the Raiders to that list. The 42-year-old defensive coordinator joined the Chargers in 2024 after opting to leave Michigan along with head coach Jim Harbaugh, and has led his defense to back-to-back top-10 defensive seasons. In 2024, the Chargers allowed the fewest points of any team in the league while also finishing 11th in total yards allowed. Minter could see more interviews come his way this week as teams continue to move past the first phase of the hiring cycle and narrow their list of candidates.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Packers DC Jeff Hafley will meet with the Raiders on Wednesday for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d663-dc7a-af9b-dfff21150000</link>
      <description>Hafley has already met with other teams this coaching cycle and has a second interview with the Dolphins on tap. The 46-year-old coach has led top-12 defenses in back-to-back seasons since leaving the college game for the pros in 2024 and remains a hot name on the market with seven head coaching vacancies still left to be filled.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Browns will have a second interview with Rams pass game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase for their head-coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d664-d35e-a1bf-d7e6a9cb0000</link>
      <description>With the Rams advancing to the NFC Championship Game after Sunday’s win over the Bears, the Browns will be restricted from interviewing Scheelhaase until next Monday at the earliest. The 35-year-old coach has met with several teams this hiring cycle, but any teams seriously considering hiring Scheelhaase will have to delay all hiring decisions by a week as the postseason continues to play out. Scheelhaase first joined the Rams in 2024 and was elevated to pass game coordinator ahead of this season. The latest coveted coach off the Sean McVay coaching tree could soon land a head coaching job if he and the Rams continue their impressive postseason run.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Jaguars DC Anthony Campanile with interview for the Ravens’ head-coaching vacancy on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-d674-d968-a19b-def522310000</link>
      <description>The Ravens are on a short list of teams interested in Campanile’s services, joining the Titans and Dolphins as potential suitors. The 43-year-old excelled in his first season as an NFL defensive coordinator in 2025, as his Jaguars finished eighth in points allowed and 11th in yards allowed while also boasting a top-10 run and pass defense on a per attempt basis. Should the Ravens move to hire him, Campanile would take over a defense that is already loaded with talent, but underperformed under second-year defensive coordinator Zach Orr.</description>
