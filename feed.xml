      <title>Aaron Jones rushed five times for 15 yards in the Vikings’ Week 8 loss to the Chargers while adding two catches for 15 yards.</title>

      <description>Jones was making his return from injured reserve, and he and the Vikings found almost no rushing room with a total of 34 yards on the ground on just 11 attempts. The 30-year-old likely will see more touches in Week 9 against the Lions after a mini-bye, but he’s more of a FLEX option than someone fantasy managers must have in their lineup.</description>

      <title>Jaret Patterson rushed 11 times for 39 yards in the Chargers’ Week 8 win over the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-143e-deb1-a39b-353e2a6a0000</link>
      <description>Patterson was clearly the backup to Kimani Vidal (23-117-1), but the 25-year-old did a solid job as the backup while receiving his first NFL touches since 2022. The former University of Buffalo star could be operate behind Vidal again in Week 9 against the Titans, but that will largely be determined by the health of Hassan Haskins (hamstring).</description>

      <title>Oronde Gadsden II caught 5-of-5 targets for 77 yards and a touchdown in the Chargers’ Week 8 win over the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-143e-d5d8-a3ff-fd7f306b0000</link>
      <description>All of the production was in the first half, but it showed that the breakout game Gadsden had against the Colts in Week 7 wasn’t (entirely) a fluke. He scored the first touchdown on the game on a dart over the middle from Justin Herbert. The 22-year-old likely would have had a much bigger statline if this game was close in the second half. It was not. Gadsden is absolutely a TE1 for a Week 9 battle against the lowly Titans.</description>

      <title>ladd McConkey caught 6-of-10 targets for 88 yards and a touchdown in the Chargers’ Week 8 win over the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-143e-d5d8-a3ff-fd7f37870000</link>
      <description>McConkey streaked down the sideline for a 27-yard touchdown from Justin Herbert and give the Chargers a 21-3 lead. The second-year wideout disappointed in the first half of the season for the most part, but this the third straight game where he’s gone over 65 yards, and he’s scored in three of his last four. He’s locked in as a WR2 for a Week 9 showdown against the Titans.</description>

      <title>Keenan Allen caught 4-of-5 targets for 44 yards in the Chargers’ Week 8 win over the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-143e-d245-adfb-957f3d420000</link>
      <description>It was a quiet day for Allen, and it’s disappointing on a day where Justin Herbert was able to find the end zone three times. Some of this has to do with the fact that the Chargers won by five scores, but it’s worth noting that Los Angeles may be in blowout territory again in Week 9 against the Titans. Still, Allen is a high-floor WR3 for that contest and going forward.</description>

      <title>Tre Harris caught 2-of-2 targets for eight yards and a touchdown in the Chargers’ Week 8 win over the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-143e-d245-adfb-957f43650000</link>
      <description>Harris has his first receiving touchdown of his career on a short completion from Justin Herbert. The second-round pick was a non-factor in the contest outside of that, in part because of Los Angeles going run-heavy in a blowout, and in larger part because Harris just isn’t a part of this Chargers’ offensive scheme. He’s off the radar for Week 9 against the Titans.</description>

      <title>Quentin Johnston didn’t receive a target in the Chargers’ Week 8 win over the Vikings.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1444-deb1-a39b-354edfc10000</link>
      <description>Johnston’s lack of involvement could have something to do with the hamstring issue he had coming into Week 7, and also because the Chargers were running the ball an awful lot against the Minnesota front. Still, zero targets is beyond concerning; especially when you see “tight end” Oronde Gadsden so much more involved in this offense (5-77-1). Johnston is a very risky FLEX play for Week 9 against the Titans.</description>

      <title>Justin Jefferson caught 7-of-11 targets for 74 yards in the Vikings’ Week 8 loss to the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1446-deb1-a39b-354e5cac0000</link>
      <description>Jefferson was the best player for the Vikings, but that’s not saying a whole lot. Carson Wentz was under constant pressure — and wasn’t good even when he wasn’t — and the fact Jefferson was able to accrue this many yards is impressive with context. Jefferson will likely have J.J. McCarthy throwing him the football in Week 9 against the Lions. He’s a WR1 regardless, but it remains to be seen if that’s an upgrade or not.</description>

      <title>Jordan Addison caught 3-of-4 targets for 26 yards and a touchdown in the Vikings’ Week 8 loss to the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1451-d245-adfb-955f05010000</link>
      <description>Addison salvaged his fantasy day with a short scoring pass from Carson Wentz. It’s a disappointing effort, but an understandable one with Wentz struggling to stay upright and throwing ineffectively even when he did have time. Addison is a WR3 for the Week 9 contest against the Lions, but one who offers some upside even with some question marks as to who will be under center for Minnesota in that contest.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1451-d245-adfb-955f05010000</guid>

      <title>T.J. Hockenson caught 2-of-3 targets for 26 yards in the Vikings’ Week 8 loss to the Chargers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-1454-deb1-a39b-355eae3a0000</link>
      <description>Hockenson’s three targets are a season low, and unfortunately more inline to his disappointing first two contests when he had a combined 27 yards. The 28-year-old tight end is a decent bounceback candidate for Week 9 against his former team in the Lions, but it’s worth noting that J.J. McCarthy could be under center for that contest, and Hockenson and McCarthy didn’t appear to have much of a connection early on. Just something to keep in mind.</description>
