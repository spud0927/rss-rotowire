      <title>Bears RB Kyle Monangai (thigh) did not practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cacc-def2-abdb-dfedb4790000</link>
      <description>This is unfortunate. Monangai reportedly entered the Bears’ Week 5 bye with a clean bill of health, so it is unclear as to when this injury occurred. The rookie running back won the No. 2 role behind D’Andre Swift in training camp. If he is unable to return in time for his team’s Monday Night Football game against the Commanders this week, No. 3 RB Roschon Johnson could get an opportunity to fight for the primary backup job.</description>

      <title>Bears TE Colston Loveland (hip) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cae3-dd4c-afb9-efe3bfc80000</link>
      <description>Loveland is coming off a Week 5 bye. It would have been nice to see him practice in full today, but his early-week participation does put him on track to play in the Bears’ Week 6 Monday Night Football game against the Commanders. Unfortunately, he can only be stashed on benches at this point.</description>

      <title>Saints RB Alvin Kamara (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cae6-d94a-a79d-cbef3f0a0000</link>
      <description>That makes two limited sessions for Kamara, who reportedly injured his ankle in Week 5 against the Giants. He left practice early on Wednesday after experiencing soreness. The injury is not believed to be serious and his continued participation puts him on track to play in Week 6 against the Patriots. Assuming he is good to go come Sunday, he can be treated as an RB2, though it would be unsurprising to see Kendre Miller handle a near-even workload with him.</description>

      <title>Saints TE Juwan Johnson (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cad2-dd4c-afb9-efd37ba00000</link>
      <description>Johnson is firmly on track to play in Week 6 against the Patriots, but with Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau back in the lineup, Johnson is now just a high-end TE2 in re-draft formats. If Johnson can produce a high-end TE1 finish in the coming weeks, it would be wise to try to sell high on him.</description>

      <title>Titans RB Tyjae Spears (ankle) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-caef-def2-abdb-dfef835d0000</link>
      <description>This is likely just a maintenance day for Spears, who returned from injured reserve last week. Earlier this week, Titans head coach Brian Callahan said Spears will see an increased role going forward, though expectations should be held in check. He ran the ball four times and earned zero targets. Spears in closer to a bench stash than he is a reliable FLEX.</description>

      <title>Chargers WR Quentin Johnston (hamstring) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cafb-d94a-a79d-cbffea090000</link>
      <description>Johnston’s continued participation is positive regarding his Week 6 availability. Johnston’s 22.9 percent team target share trails only Keenan Allen’s 25.3 percent. If active, the No. 2 target earner has a wonderfully soft matchup against the Dolphins’ fantasy-friendly defense. It would be great to see Johnston practice in full on Friday.</description>

      <title>Tua Tagovailoa (hip/left thumb) practiced in full on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-caf6-d94a-a79d-cbffb44d0000</link>
      <description>Tagovailoa should now be good to go for Week 6 against the Chargers, though he will likely be playing a little bit banged up. The Dolphins’ veteran quarterback has finished as a QB2 in 3-of-5 games this season and will likely do so again this week. The Chargers’ secondary is a solid unit that should be able to keep the Dolphins’ lesser pass catchers in check.</description>

      <title>49ers QB Mac Jones (knee/oblique) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cb10-dd4c-afb9-efd17d4e0000</link>
      <description>Earlier today, 49ers general manager John Lynch said Jones “should be OK” for Week 6 against the Buccaneers. His continued participation confirms that. In three appearances this season, Jones has finished as the QB6, QB15 and QB10. He can be expected to finish in that range again this week, perhaps with a lean toward the mid-tier QB1 group.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cb10-dd4c-afb9-efd17d4e0000</guid>

      <title>49ers WR Jauan Jennings (ankle/ribs) was limited on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cb17-def2-abdb-df775d5b0000</link>
      <description>Jennings often plays through injuries when he is able to practice in a limited capacity. He did so earlier this year, practicing only on Friday in Week 2 and went on to catch 5-of-10 targets for 89 yards and one touchdown. Situations can change quickly, but for now, fantasy managers should expect Jennings to play in Week 6 against the Buccaneers, operating as his team’s No. 1 wide receiver.</description>

      <title>Eagles declared DT Jalen Carter (heel) inactive for Week 6 against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-cb24-def2-abdb-df6579080000</link>
      <description>Carter was added to the injury report yesterday, so his absence is hardly surprising. The Eagles’ defense is a talented unit overall, but losing one of the best defensive linemen in football is a big deal. The Giants will likely attack the Eagles’ interior defensive line via an aggressive rushing attack. The Eagles also declared LG Landon Dickerson, TE Grant Calcaterra, CB Mac McWilliams and WR Xavier Gipson inactive for Week 6 against the Giants. On the plus side, LB Nakobe Dean (knee) will make his 2025 debut tonight.</description>
