      <title>Drake Maye said his shoulder injury was “significant” headed into the Super Bowl.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4826-d042-afbc-7df63cc80000</link>
      <description>Maye, following his Super Bowl meltdown against the Seahawks, said the right shoulder issue hampered his ability to throw the football against Seattle’s elite secondary. He had been on the Patriots’ injury report for two weeks ahead of the Super Bowl. Maye picked up the shoulder ailment in the Pats’ AFC title game win over the Broncos. He said he did not expect to require surgery on the shoulder. Maye will likely enter 2026 fully healthy.</description>

      <title>Patriots LT Will Campbell said he played through a torn knee ligament this season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-482c-d629-a1bc-f83d8fff0000</link>
      <description>Campbell said the injury was no excuse for his abysmal play in the postseason, including in the Patriots’ Super Bowl loss to the Seahawks. Campbell was overwhelmed by the Seattle front seven from start to finish, as Drake Maye was pressured on 29 of his 53 drop backs and sacked six times. Campbell will presumably have offseason surgery to fix the injury. Hopefully for the Patriots, Campbell — the fourth overall selection in the 2025 NFL Draft — will be better in 2026 than he was during his disastrous finish to the 2025 campaign.</description>

      <title>Deshaun Watson settled the last two sexual misconduct civil lawsuits against him.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-4841-d042-afbc-7dd3d9550000</link>
      <description>The settlements come just weeks before the cases were slated to reach court. They were among the 27 civil suits filed against Watson since 2021 by women accusing him of sexual misconduct during massage appointments. Watson was fined $5 million and suspended for 11 games in 2022. His career has since tanked. Watson has suffered multiple Achilles tendon ruptures and his on-field performance has been as poor as any starting QB in the NFL over the past few years. Entering his age-31 season, Watson will compete for Cleveland’s starting job this summer.</description>

      <title>Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel said Will Campbell will remain at left tackle in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48b2-d355-a5bd-cff691d50000</link>
      <description>Vrabel on Tuesday offered a vociferous defense of the rookie following his postseason struggles while playing through a major knee injury. “Will is 22 years old. He’s our left tackle. He’ll get better. He’ll get stronger,” Vrabel said. “There’s plays he’d like to have back. We’re not moving Will to guard, center, tight end or anywhere else.” Pro Football Focus graded Campbell 110th out of 200 qualifying offensive linemen in pass blocking this season. He was graded 81st in run blocking. Campbell allowed nine sacks in 2025, the third most among all NFL offensive linemen. Assuming he’ll undergo offseason knee surgery, Campbell should be good to go for the 2026 season.</description>

      <title>Giants interviewed former Titans head coach Brian Callahan for their quarterbacks coach vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48c8-d629-a1bc-f8ddc60f0000</link>
      <description>Unable to even find an offensive coordinator role, Callahan’s only real door appeared to close when Dan Pitcher remained with the Bengals. The Giants would be pairing two former NFL head coaches in Callahan and offensive coordinator Matt Nagy to try to develop Jaxson Dart. The experience is about the only comforting thing about that sentence given how poorly the two did developing their young quarterbacks in their most recent opportunities.</description>

      <title>Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio reports the Steelers are “in no hurry” to get an answer from Aaron Rodgers and “definitely want” him to return for 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48cb-d042-afbc-7ddbe6830000</link>
      <description>Well here’s a whole news cycle for the next five months, anyway. Again, it’s hard to argue that there’s a better fate for the Steelers out there between the lack of non-No. 1 overall quarterbacks in this year’s draft and how diminished free agency looks this year. But if you were hoping for a quick retirement after Mike Tomlin gracefully resigned his position, we can welcome you back to the 2025 Offseason Part II. We’ll have more of the same for the next several blurbs on Rodgers.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Matt Schneidman believes Jordan Morgan will start at left tackle for the Packers in 2026.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48d8-d89c-a1be-efdf9dee0000</link>
      <description>In other words, he believes Rasheed Walker will leave in free agency — even going as far as to wonder about Walker getting the snaps at left tackle last year as being related to a potential compensatory draft pick for the Packers. Morgan had an average 62.0 PFF grade in 2025, starting two games at tackle in the regular season and one in the playoffs. He looked better at right tackle in place of the injured Zach Tom than he did at left tackle.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Turron Davenport believes “it isn’t out of the realm” for the Titans to keep Calvin Ridley and add Wan’Dale Robinson in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48db-d89c-a1be-efdf8af90000</link>
      <description>The Titans already have $100 million in cap space, so releasing Ridley wouldn’t exactly free them up to go anywhere they couldn’t already go. (Davenport admits it could still happen.) Robinson, a former Giant, would obviously be a worthwhile fit with his old head coach Brian Daboll calling plays in Tennessee. It’s very obvious that Cam Ward didn’t have enough weapons to work with last year, and while we’d stop short of calling Robinson a game changer for the Titans, he could at least help them figure out more about Ward in his second season.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Matt Barrows believes the trade market for Mac Jones will be “robust” and “there’s a good chance they’ll get an offer they can’t refuse.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48e5-d629-a1bc-f8fd914f0000</link>
      <description>Barrows concludes by saying he thinks the 49ers could get a second-round pick for Jones, or perhaps a third-round pick and a sweetener. While we don’t doubt that the 49ers think their team stability is worth a lot at quarterback — and we’ve heard both national reporters and Kyle Shanahan say recently that they don’t think they’ll move on from Jones — at some point the 49ers need to embrace the fact that they rehabbed his value from nothing and could likely do so again with a different quarterback. Given how thirsty things might get on the quarterback streets this year, we concur with Barrows that there’s a real chance Jones goes for a Day 2 pick.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Ryan McFadden believes Alec Pierce and Rashid Shaheed are players the Raiders “could target” in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-48e9-d629-a1bc-f8fde9410000</link>
      <description>Part of the offensive overhaul under Klint Kubiak will be to figure out how to fix last year’s wideout room, which ended the season with Tre Tucker and a dusty Tyler Lockett getting the majority of the snaps. Franchise-tagging Pierce could be in play for the Colts. Kubiak just spent half a season with Shaheed, so that pairing has some extra juice. (Though it should be noted Shaheed didn’t exactly thrive on offense with Kubiak.)</description>
