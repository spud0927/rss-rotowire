      <title>Raiders LT Kolton Miller (ankle) reverted to injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-76ba-d56e-afff-f6fa50e60000</link>
      <description>Miller’s 21-day practice window expired. His season is over. It is yet another unfortunate development in the Raiders’ lost 2025 season. Miller has been sidelined since suffering a high-ankle sprain and a hairline fracture in Week 4 against the Bears. His 89.8 PFF pass-blocking grade ranks second among offensive tackles with at least 250 blocking snaps. He turns 31 in September 2026. Hopefully, he can return to form next season.</description>

      <title>Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said Geno Smith (ankle) will not play Week 18 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-76c6-dc7a-af9b-ffffce3f0000</link>
      <description>It appears as though Smith’s season is over. Earlier today, Vegas Nation’s Vincent Bonsignore reported that the Raiders will use “a combination of Kenny Pickett and Aidan O’Connell” this week. Neither player should be in starting lineups, in what sounds like some sort of game-day platoon. In his first season with the Raiders, Smith completed 302-of-448 passes for 3,025 yards, 19 touchdowns and 17 interceptions, while rushing 41 times for 109 yards. He is under contract through 2027, though he is owed no money that season. If the Raiders were to cut him this offseason, it would cost them $18.5 million in dead money while saving them $8 million.</description>

      <title>Raiders WR Jack Bech (back) is practicing fully for Week 18 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-76d9-d56e-afff-f6f944b30000</link>
      <description>Bech is back. Whether that means much for the Raiders’ Week 18 outlook remains to be seen. The underwhelming rookie will at least have a chance to put a good game on film for whichever coaching staff is there to review it in 2026, though. Bech is a low-floor FLEX this week.</description>

      <title>Chiefs RB Kareem Hunt (illness) did not practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-76c7-d56e-afff-f6ef86b70000</link>
      <description>The Chiefs rotated three running backs last week, rendering all low-floor options. If Hunt’s illness were to sideline him on game day, both RB Isiah Pacheco and RB Brashard Smith would get a projections boost against the Raiders’ porous defense in Week 18.</description>

      <title>Chiefs WR Xavier Worthy (illness) did not practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-76d8-dc7a-af9b-fffff7480000</link>
      <description>Worthy has performed underwhelmingly for quite some time. Illnesses rarely keep players sidelined on game day, so we expect him out there against the Raiders this week, though he will likely be stuck running cardio for much of it. Worthy is a touchdown-dependent FLEX option in Week 18.</description>

      <title>Chargers RB Omarion Hampton (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-76e3-d968-a19b-7ef312380000</link>
      <description>Hampton is a candidate to sit out in Week 18 against the Broncos. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh has already ruled out QB Justin Herbert (hand), and told reporters earlier this week that getting his players healthy is a priority this week. Chargers backup RB Jaret Patterson could handle a decent workload, with Nos. 2 and 3 RBs, Kimani Vidal (neck) and Hassan Haskins (concussion), limited on Wednesday.</description>

      <title>Chargers RB Kimani Vidal (neck) was limited on Wednesday.</title>

      <description>Chargers starting RB Omarion Hampton (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh has only ruled out QB Justin Herbert (hand) thus far, though other starters could also be ruled out as the week progresses. Chargers No. 3 RB Hassan Haskins (concussion) was limited as well. Backup RB Jaret Patterson can be stashed by running back-needy fantasy managers.</description>

      <title>49ers TE George Kittle (ankle) said he is feeling “fabulous” and “absolutely” expects to play in Week 18 against the Seahawks.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-76ed-d968-a19b-7efd284e0000</link>
      <description>Kittle resumed practicing in a limited capacity on Tuesday. We do not yet know his participation level today, but he is certainly on the right side of questionable for Saturday’s game. The Seahawks field an elite defense, but Kittle should be started as a high-end TE1 all the same.</description>

      <title>Philip Rivers said he intends to retire after 18 seasons in the NFL.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-76ed-dc7a-af9b-ffff369c0000</link>
      <description>Rivers could still suit up as a backup one last time, but it appears as though his time in the NFL has finally come to a close. Kay Adams spoke with Rivers on Wednesday, pressing him on the matter. The 44-year-old quarterback reiterated that it is, indeed, time to hang up his cleats. In three games with the Colts, Rivers completed 58-of-92 passes for four touchdowns and three interceptions.</description>

      <title>Seahawks WR Rashid Shaheed (concussion) was seen practicing on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-7703-dc7a-af9b-ffbf84920000</link>
      <description>Shaheed was seen practicing without a red non-contact jersey today. That is a good sign regarding his availability for the Seahawks’ Week 18 game against the 49ers on Saturday. If he is indeed cleared to play, Shaheed warrants WR3/FLEX treatment against the 49ers’ fantasy-friendly defense. The game’s outcome determines both the NFC West champion and the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed.</description>
