      <title>Seahawks TE AJ Barner (calf) was limited in Wednesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5673-d713-ad9e-7e77a1e40000</link>
      <description>Barner popped up with a limited practice estimate on Wednesday. The 23-year-old has been splitting pass-catching duties with rookie Elijah Arroyo, tallying 21 receptions for 236 yards and four scores on the season. A limited estimation in a walkthrough is no cause for concern yet. Expect Barner to still play Week 10 against the Cardinals.</description>

      <title>Cardinals CB Max Melton (concussion) did not participate in Wednesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-567f-d673-a39e-f6ffb8ab0000</link>
      <description>Melton suffered a hit to the head in the Cardinals’ Week 9 Monday victory over the Cowboys. He is listed as a non-participant on Wednesday with a concussion. It will be difficult for Melton to pass concussion protocol on a short week heading into a Week 10 matchup against the Seahawks. LB Mack Wilson Sr. (ribs) also was listed with a DNP designation. Both players will need practice time later this week to play.</description>

      <title>Rams WR Puka Nacua (chest) was limited in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-56a5-d713-ad9e-7ef5dbba0000</link>
      <description>Nacua suffered a chest injury in Week 9 against the Saints and did not return. Head coach Sean McVay after the game explained Nacua suffered a rib injury and could have returned. Nacua was officially listed as a limited participant on Wednesday as McVay said earlier in the day that the 24-year-old is expected to play Week 10 against the 49ers.</description>

      <title>Rams WR Jordan Whittington (back) did not participate in Wednesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-56ab-d673-a39e-f6bb08390000</link>
      <description>Whittington was a non-participant on Wednesday with a back injury. He has 12 receptions for 121 yards this season as a distant No. 3 wide receiver to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams. If Whittington misses Week 10 against the 49ers, Konata Mumpfield and Xavier Smith could see an uptick in routes.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports the Dolphins view WR Jaylen Waddle as part of their “new future.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-56f3-d713-ad9e-7ef7c0b20002</link>
      <description>The Dolphins received calls on the 26-year-old wideout, including from the Denver Broncos. However, Wolfe reports the Dolphins wanted a “Quinnen Williams or Sauce Gardner type return” for Waddle. This would have consisted of at least one first-rounder and another first- or second-round pick, but there was not a market for this kind of return for him. The Dolphins view Waddle as a part of their future, whether that includes the current Tua Tagovailoa/Mike McDaniel quarterback-coach combination or not. Trade rumors will certainly resurface in the offseason, though Miami is clearly reluctant to part ways with the speedy former No. 6 overall pick.</description>

      <title>Cowboys announced the passing of Marshawn Kneeland at the age of 24.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-599c-d45b-affe-5d9e6ffc0000</link>
      <description>Kneeland’s agent confirmed the news shortly after Dallas released their statement. From their statement, “It is with extreme sadness that the Dallas Cowboys share that Marshawn Kneeland tragically passed away this morning. Marshawn was a beloved teammate and member of our organization. Our thoughts and prayers regarding Marshawn are with his girlfriend Catalina and his family.”</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Nate Taylor reports the Chiefs offered the Jets a 2026 fourth-round pick for Breece Hall.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-59d2-d713-ad9e-7dd626880000</link>
      <description>Hall was arguably the biggest trade candidate on the Jets heading into Tuesday’s deadline. In the middle of another lost season, the Jets were massive sellers, moving on from defensive stars Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams. The fact that they were willing to axe a trade for over the difference between a third and fourth-round pick is almost stunning. Hall is an impending free agent and New York is at the ground floor of a rebuild. This could mean that they will try to re-sign him in the spring or that he is a candidate for the transition tag. Either way, Hall will close out his rookie contract as a member of the Jets. The Chiefs will move forward with Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt splitting their backfield.</description>

      <title>Colts CB Sauce Gardner has cleared the league’s concussion protocol and is expected to play in Week 10 against the Falcons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-59d9-d673-a39e-fdd9f0e70000</link>
      <description>Head coach Shane Steichen told reporters earlier in the week that the plan was for Gardner to suit up this week if he cleared concussion protocol in time. He should be in the starting lineup on Sunday. Gardner will be tasked with covering Drake London in his Colts debut.</description>

      <title>Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) did not practice Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5a18-d673-a39e-fe993ae80000</link>
      <description>Irving hasn’t played since Week 4 and a Week 9 bye was not enough to get him back on the practice field. Two DNPs to open the week all but guarantee another missed game for the young back. Rachaad White will likely draw the start again this week. Facing a New England defense that is giving up the fewest rushing yards in the league to opposing running backs, White will be a low-end RB2 at best for Week 10.</description>

      <title>Chris Godwin (fibula) did not practice Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-5a1b-d1e7-a1fa-5afbf2540000</link>
      <description>It looks like Godwin will miss another week while dealing with the fibula issue. At this point, it’s unclear when he will return to action. With Mike Evans also sidelined, Emeka Egbuka will continue to go unchallenged as the Bucs’ WR1. Sterlin Shepard and Tez Johnson will round out the team’s starting wide receiver trio.</description>
