      <title>Giants HC Brian Daboll said Andrew Thomas (foot) is taking his recovery day by day and “getting better.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b859-df63-a199-f97b12f10000</link>
      <description>Giants GM Joe Schoen said in July that Thomas should be good to go for Week 1 against the Commanders, but the team is in no rush to predict a return. Speaking on Sunday, Daboll said the decision to activate Thomas would be based on what Thomas and the team consider to be best. It’s about as predictable a response as we could expect. Thomas is rehabbing from a foot injury that ended his season in October and opened camp on the PUP list. If he is activated before camp ends, he would have roughly three weeks to be ready for Week 1.</description>

      <title>Cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot reports Shedeur Sanders (oblique) ‘tossed some short passes to tight end David Njoku in pregame warmups.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b89f-df63-a199-f9bf22d30000</link>
      <description>According to Cabot, Sanders’ throwing session has raised hopes that he will be able to get on the field in the Browns’ preseason finale against the Rams next week. The rookie missed Saturday’s game against the Eagles due to an oblique injury he suffered late in the week, but there’s hope that with enough time to recover, he should be ready for next Saturday’s game. Sanders could be one of several Browns quarterbacks to see action next week, as head coach Kevin Stefanski said he hopes to have all four quarterbacks healthy. It seems unlikely that Joe Flacco would suit up, but Sanders, along with Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, could all see ample reps as they look to solidify their spots on the depth chart.</description>

      <title>Jaguars WR/CB Travis Hunter (upper body) will not play in Sunday’s preseason game against the Saints.</title>

      <description>Hunter is dealing with a non-specified upper body injury that was reported on Friday. Head coach Liam Coen hinted that Hunter might miss Sunday’s game due to the injury, but this appears to be a minor issue that shouldn’t carry over into Week 1.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports the Bengals “are listening to trade offers” for Trey Hendrickson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b8d3-d05a-adda-bad3343e0000</link>
      <description>Rapoport writes that “with contract talks at an impasse,” the Bengals are finally open to dealing the 2024 sack leader. A willingness to deal Hendrickson would have been better for everybody if the Bengals had considered this months ago, but now the four-time Pro Bowler will hope to find a new home and contract with just three weeks to go before the start of the season. Hendrickson has been holding in at Bengals camp since reporting on July 30th, and would likely need some time to ramp up for the start of the season. In theory, he should have several suitors on the market, but a trade could prove difficult given the pick compensation the acquiring team would have to give up, along with the money that would come from giving Hendrickson a new contract.</description>

      <title>NFL insider Jordan Schultz reports the Panthers, Browns, and Colts are among the teams interested in trading for Trey Hendrickson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b910-df63-a199-f93b41c00000</link>
      <description>An in-division trade with the Browns feels like the most unlikely outcome, but we’ll assume any deal can be had with the right price. According to Schultz, the Bengals are “believed to want an impact player (or two) plus a draft pick” in exchange for Hendrickson’s services. It will be an obviously steep price to pay for any team that hopes to acquire the star pass-rusher, and any team willing to make the trade will also have to have room to sign Hendrickson to a new deal. Schultz also notes that the Bengals and Hendrickson prefer to stay together, but that contract negotiations “keep hitting a wall.” We’ll see where things go from here, but for now, we have three teams to watch as trade negotiations spark up.</description>

      <title>Trevor Lawrence completed 8-of-10 passes for 77 yards and one touchdown in the Jaguars’ preseason game against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b91e-d45c-a7fc-bb1e89cf0000</link>
      <description>Lawrence played on two drives in the Jaguars’ second preseason game and saw four of his completions go for 10-plus yards. A strong first drive ended on a fumbled handoff between Lawrence and Tank Bigsby after Lawrence’s foot got caught up under his center when taking the snap. His second drive, however, ended on a seven-yard touchdown pass to Parker Washington and gave Lawrence his first touchdown of the preseason. Through two games, Lawrence has completed 14-of-17 passes for 120 yards and one touchdown and has taken no sacks on three pressures. For now, he’ll profile as a mid QB2 in fantasy but could be a candidate for a breakout season in his first year under Liam Coen.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jordan Raanan reports Malik Nabers is dealing with a back injury that’s been described as “normal back tightness.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b937-d45c-a7fc-bb3f8d9b0000</link>
      <description>It was reported last week that Nabers was missing practice due to a shoulder injury. Now, there’s a back injury that may or may not be related to his shoulder injury. It’s hard to know without an official team injury report. Regardless, Nabers hasn’t practiced in 11 days and seems unlikely to appear in the team’s final preseason game against the Patriots next week. Head coach Brian Daboll declared last week that he’s “not going to get into any injuries,” which he has largely stuck to this offseason. At this point, the best we can do is hope this is a minor issue for Nabers that won’t keep him out for Week 1 when the Giants visit the Commanders, but we may not get any clear insight on his situation until the week leading up to the game. Nabers caught 109 passes for 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns last season and profiles as a strong WR1 in half and full-PPR formats.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reports the Bengals “have been actively engaged in trade discussions surrounding Trey Hendrickson for weeks.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b94c-d05a-adda-bbce650c0000</link>
      <description>This report comes after NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that the Bengals are now listening to trade offers. It’s minor semantics, but worth pointing out that a prolonged discussion to move the star pass rusher could suggest that the Bengals are willing to deal Hendrickson for the right price. According to Russini, the Bengals are specifically eyeing defensive players in addition to draft capital for Hendrickson. Regardless of asking price, the most difficult part of getting a deal done will come down to what the acquiring team is willing to offer the Bengals and also Hendrickson in a contract extension. A trade won’t be impossible to pull off, but it will come at a very steep price.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Seahawks LB Uchenna Nwosu (knee) passed his physical and is cleared to return to practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b94f-d45c-a7fc-bb5fa2f60000</link>
      <description>Nwosu opened training camp on the PUP list after undergoing a cleanup procedure on his knee earlier in the offseason. The eighth-year pro totaled 14 tackles and one sack in six games for the Seahawks last season and has been limited to just 12 games since 2023. With roughly three weeks to go until the start of the season, there’s a good chance Nwosu will be active for Week 1 against the 49ers if he looks good in practice.</description>

      <title>Tyler Shough completed 9-of-12 passes for 65 yards in the Saints’ preseason game against the Jaguars.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-b959-df63-a199-f97baa510000</link>
      <description>Shough played the entire first half, leading the Saints to three points on four drives while taking an intentional grounding penalty along with two sacks. His only completion of 10-plus yards came on a 28-yard pass to second-year UDFA Treyton Welch. He didn’t turn the ball over, but Shough’s outing wasn’t exactly mistake-free, and it won’t do much to separate him from the pack in the Saints’ quarterback competition. This remains a QB battle to watch heading into the final week of camp.</description>
