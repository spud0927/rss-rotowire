      <title>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer reports the Cardinals and Raiders are “both waiting to talk” to Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak before making a final decision on their head-coaching vacancies.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b97-d355-a5bd-8fd7741a0000</link>
      <description>Both teams are scheduled to have an in-person interview with Kubiak on Saturday per Breer. The Raiders have been positioned as the “prime candidate” and Kubiak’s “job to lose” in recent days, but it might come down to which team he feels more comfortable with. These are two of the weakest organizations in the NFL over the past three seasons. Kubiak may ultimately be choosing between Fernando Mendoza and the vacuum that the Cardinals have at quarterback with Kyler Murray expected to be traded.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Todd Archer believes Cowboys RB Jaydon Blue “comes into camp as the No. 3 back at best.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b9f-d355-a5bd-8fdfdceb0000</link>
      <description>“Even if [Javonte] Williams does not re-sign, the Cowboys will look to find a lead back in free agency,” Archer adds. Blue had a nice meaningless Week 18 game where he almost doubled his carry total for the season and scored, but we agree with Archer that it’s hard to view him as a potential 2026 lead back for the Cowboys at this point. Blue’s dynasty stock is well down from its 2025 preseason peak.</description>

      <title>LSU OC Charlie Weis Jr. “keeps coming up in league circles” regarding the Giants’ offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0bbd-dead-af9e-6fbfe4120000</link>
      <description>SNY TV’s Connor Hughes notes that Weis arrived at Ole Miss the same year as Giants QB Jaxson Dart (2022), serving as his quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator all three years. The two reportedly remain close. Reuniting them makes sense.</description>

      <title>Eagles completed an interview with Texans QB coach Jerrod Johnson for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b82-dead-af9e-6f874aaf0000</link>
      <description>Johnson interviewed for the role in-person today, having advanced to the second round of interviews earlier this week. He was previously linked to the Dolphins’ offensive coordinator vacancy as well. Johnson has served in his current role with the Texans since 2023.</description>

      <title>49ers completed an interview with former Falcons head coach Raheem Morris for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0bcd-d355-a5bd-8fdd6fd10000</link>
      <description>Morris spent the last two seasons serving as the Falcons’ head coach. Before that, he served as defensive coordinator for the 49ers’ division-rival Rams from 2021-2023. He held myriad roles with the Falcons from 2015-2020, coaching on both sides of the ball, including wide receivers and defensive backs.</description>

      <title>49ers completed an interview with Raiders pass game coordinator and DB coach Joe Woods for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0bcd-dead-af9e-6fcfd6cc0000</link>
      <description>This is Woods’ first reported interview in 2026. He has been in his current roles with the Raiders for just one season, and served as the Saints’ defensive coordinator from 2023-2024. Aside from the Saints, Woods has also served as defensive coordinator with the Browns (2020-2022) and Broncos (2017-2018).</description>

      <title>Steelers hired James Campen as their new offensive line coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0bd7-dead-af9e-6fd7f4760000</link>
      <description>Campen previously coached the Packers’ offensive line under head coach Mike McCarthy and notably served as his run game coordinator for one season as well. Campen has been out of football for the past two seasons, most recently having coached the Panthers’ offensive line from 2022-2023.</description>

      <title>Eagles hired Sean Mannion as their new offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0bdf-dfd7-a5dc-0fff43cf0000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero believes “a schematic shift coming to Philly,” noting that Mannion played under Rams head coach Sean McVay and Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell before serving as quarterbacks coach for the Packers under head coach Matt LaFleur. All three coaches use play action, shifts and motion far more than the Eagles did under former OC Kevin Patullo. Pelissero’s belief is reasonable and bodes positively for a more fantasy-friendly environment in 2026.</description>

      <title>Chiefs requested an interview with Raiders RB coach Deland McCullough for their running backs coach vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b8e-d355-a5bd-8fdec05a0000</link>
      <description>Prior to taking his job with the Raiders last offseason, McCullough coached in the college ranks for four years. Before that, he coached Chiefs running backs from 2018-2020. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid is evidently hoping to recapture some of his old rushing attack’s magic. The Chiefs ranked 12th in yards per carry (4.5) during McCullough’s final regular season with the team. They averaged 4.2 this year.</description>

      <title>Falcons completed and interview with Texans assistant general manager James Liipfert for the general manager vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0bf8-d042-afbc-7ffa25ac0000</link>
      <description>Liipfert is reportedly a finalist, alongside Bears assistant general manager Ian Cunningham. Both candidates completed second-round, in-person interviews today. Liipfert operates as the director of college scouting within his current role.</description>
