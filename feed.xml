      <title>Troy Franklin caught 8-of-9 targets for 89 yards and one touchdown in the Broncos’ Week 2 loss to the Colts, rushing once for 11 yards.</title>

      <description>Franklin looked like an ascending star on the Broncos’ third drive. In the a seven-play sequence, Franklin secured four of his eight receptions, ripped off a 42-yard gain and punched in Bo Nix’s second touchdown of the evening after catching a pass in the flats. He’s worth adding in re-draft formats and can be deployed in the FLEX next week against the Chargers.</description>

      <title>J.K. Dobbins rushed 14 times for 76 yards and one touchdown in the Broncos’ Week 2 loss to the Colts, adding one reception for nine yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4ae4-dc44-a9d9-4fe6456e0000</link>
      <description>Dobbins got the requisite workload to return RB2 value despite Broncos head coach Sean Payton employing a three-play rotation at the position. Passing down specialist Tyler Badie was a factor in the high-value two-minute drill, which hurts the other two Broncos backs. Dobbins faces his former team, the Chargers, next week and can be started as a low-end RB2.</description>

      <title>RJ Harvey rushed five times for eight yards in the Broncos’ Week 2 loss to the Colts, adding one reception for 16 yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4ae8-dc44-a9d9-4fee39de0000</link>
      <description>Harvey earned two targets on the day, and had a similar workload in Week 1, but unfortunately, he was unable to rip off a 50-yard gain to buoy his box score. The rookie RB also returned three kicks for 70 yards. Harvey is stuck in bench-stash land until head coach Sean Payton removes RB Tyler Badie from the offense.</description>

      <title>Evan Engram caught 1-of-2 targets for 12 yards in the Broncos’ Week 2 loss to the Colts.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4aec-d294-a19b-eefc2d440000</link>
      <description>Engram’s Broncos career is off to an ominously slow start. Dealing with a calf injury he sustained in Week 1 against the Titans, he has just four catches for 33 yards over two games. The fact that head coach Sean Payton’s second-favorite tight end, Adam Trautman, is on the roster does not help matters for Engram. Trautman caught 3-of-3 targets for 10 yards and one touchdown against Indianapolis. Engram ran 19 pass routes in Week 1 while Trautman logged nine routes. Engram drafters might want to explore other tight end options in Week 3.</description>

      <title>NFL Insider Jordan Schultz reports Bengals DE Shemar Stewart (ankle/knee) “is believed to have avoided anything major” and will likely be week-to-week.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4ae9-d86f-abdd-4ffdb8ce0000</link>
      <description>Stewart was seen on crutches after Sunday’s win over the Jaguars, but the rookie pass rusher seems to have avoided any kind of serious injury. Stewart had a highly documented holdout earlier this offseason and eventually signed and reported to camp in late July. He has recorded one tackle in two games played this season.</description>

      <title>DJ Giddens caught 0-of-1 targets in the Colts’ Week 2 win over the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4af3-d86f-abdd-4fff28880000</link>
      <description>This game remained close from start to finish, so the Colts never had a clear opportunity to get their backup rookie running back a few touches. Giddens did not rush the ball even once. On the plus side, fellow backup Tyler Goodson (elbow) was inactive for this one, suggesting Giddens is ahead of him on the depth chart at this time.</description>

      <title>Trey Benson had three rushes for 14 yards in the Cardinals’ Week 2 win against the Panthers, adding four catches for 30 yards.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b0c-d86f-abdd-4fbd7e290000</link>
      <description>Benson continues to eat into James Conner’s workload in the Arizona backfield. Benson, who had 69 yards on eight rushes last week against the Saints, ran more routes than Conner and saw six targets, the second most among Cardinals pass catchers on the day. A far more explosive option than Conner, Benson should continue seeing a small but reliable weekly workload in a run-first Arizona offense. Benson would be something close to a top-12 option if Conner were to miss time in 2025. He needs to be rostered in all formats.</description>

      <title>Tetairoa McMillan caught 6-of-10 targets for 100 yards in the Panthers’ Week 2 loss against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b1e-dc44-a9d9-4f7e92570000</link>
      <description>The rookie once again operated as Bryce Young’s clearcut No. 1 target. He saw 30 percent of Carolina’s air yards and led the Panthers in target for a second straight week. McMillan’s highlight came on a 40-yard catch and run where he showed off his vision and speed after the catch. He now has 19 targets through two games. If the Panthers continue struggling on defense, Young and McMillan could be forced into frequent pass-heavy game scripts that would inflate drop back and target volume. McMillan should be locked into all fantasy lineups for Week 3 against the Falcons.</description>

      <title>Hunter Renfrow caught 7-of-9 targets for 49 yards and two touchdowns in the Panthers’ Week 2 loss against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b26-da67-a99f-cff7f12e0000</link>
      <description>Renfrow ran as the Panthers’ primary slot receiver — as he did in Week 1 — and caught two of Bryce Young’s three touchdowns in Carolina’s furious second half comeback attempt. Hunter, as he did in his Raiders days, creates space in the short areas and is sure handed. He could function as a solid outlet for Young all season as the team’s No. 2 receiver (Xavier Legette turned eight targets into -2 yards on Sunday). Renfrow could benefit from pass-heavy game scripts this season if the Carolina defense remains one of the NFL’s worst. He’s a passable option in PPR formats for Week 3 against the Falcons.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b26-da67-a99f-cff7f12e0000</guid>

      <title>Xavier Legette caught 1-of-8 targets for -2 yards in the Panthers’ Week 2 loss against the Cardinals.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-4b2f-d294-a19b-efff530a0000</link>
      <description>Legette had one of the most stunningly inefficient games in NFL history. In fact, he’s the only player in the modern era to post negative receiving yards on eight targets. Yet he continues to run nearly all the routes in the Carolina offense. Tetairoa McMillan, meanwhile, turned ten targets into 100 yards against the Cardinals, and Hunter Renfrow saw nine targets and caught two touchdowns from Bryce Young. It wouldn’t be surprising if Legette is phased out of the Carolina offense sooner rather than later. He can remain on waiver wires.</description>
