      <title>Javonte Williams rushed 20 times for 85 yards and a touchdown in the Cowboys’ Week 4 tie against the Packers, adding 15 yards on three receptions.</title>

      <description>Williams has now reached 100 yards from scrimmage in two of four games to start the 2025 season, narrowly missing the century mark a third time in Week 3. His early-season returns highlight a massive career turnaround following a down year in 2024 with the Broncos, rewarding fantasy managers that took the gamble in the middle rounds of drafts this offseason. He is now averaging 4.9 yards per carry through the first month of play and could see an even heavier workload after backfield mate Miles Sanders departed with an ankle injury before the half. Up next for Williams and the Cowboys are the Jets in Week 5.</description>

      <title>George Pickens caught 8-of-11 targets for 134 yards and two touchdowns in the Cowboys’ Week 4 tie against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-93cf-dca3-a9fb-bfdf7f520000</link>
      <description>Pickens and the rest of the Dallas offense got off to a slow start before turning the tables on the Packers in the second quarter, punctuating both halves with touchdowns grabs inside of two minutes to play. He also added a highlight reel catch over two defenders with just under a minute to play in the first half to set up Dallas’ first touchdown of the game, a two-yard Dak Prescott carry on a draw. In all, it was both a fantastic real-world performance and a stellar fantasy outing in the absence of alpha wide receiver CeeDee Lamb. He’ll look to carry the momentum into Week 5 when the Cowboys face off against the Jets on the road.</description>

      <title>Jake Ferguson caught all seven targets for 40 yards and a touchdown in the Cowboys’ Week 4 tie against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-93d3-d95b-addb-fbd7c29a0000</link>
      <description>Ferguson ranked second on the team in targets behind only George Pickens but managed to gain only 40 yards in a low-aDOT role. Even so, his third quarter touchdown was his first score since Week 13 of the 2023 season, returning yet another usable fantasy score in the absence of alpha wide receiver CeeDee Lamb. His next opportunity to put up meaningful counting stats comes in Week 5 against the Jets.</description>

      <title>Jalen Tolbert caught 4-of-6 targets for 61 yards in the Cowboys’ Week 4 tie against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-93d7-dca3-a9fb-bfdf33060000</link>
      <description>Tolbert and KaVontae Turpin were both asked to step into increased roles in the absence of alpha wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, who missed the first of a projected 3-4 games with an ankle sprain in Week 4. It was Tolbert, and not Turpin, who returned usable fantasy stats in a PPR format, with the latter catching just 3-of-4 targets for 30 yards while adding four yards on his lone carry. Neither are recommended streaming options when the Cowboys take on the Jets on the road in Week 5.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports Darnell Mooney is unlikely to miss any games after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 4’s win over the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-957a-d95b-addb-fd7e5b3b0000</link>
      <description>The injury that forced Mooney from Sunday’s game in the first half appears to be relatively minor. With the Falcons now entering their Week 5 bye, the hope is a week away will give him enough time to recover before returning in Week 6 to prepare for a Monday night matchup with the Bills. Mooney has gotten off to a slow start this season. He’s caught 7-of-16 targets for 79 scoreless yards, but remains the Falcons’ WR2 when active. We’ll have more of an update on his availability when the Falcons release their first injury report for Week 6.</description>

      <title>DeAndre Hopkins did not catch his lone target in the Ravens’ Week 4 loss against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9599-d95b-addb-fddff99b0000</link>
      <description>Hopkins was invisible in this one, taking on more of a rotational role while Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman functioned as every-down players. With five receptions over four games, Hopkins is a fantasy non-factor that should remain on waiver wires. He won’t be fantasy viable unless Flowers and Bateman miss time.</description>

      <title>Texans traded OT Cam Robinson to the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-95f5-deb6-a7fd-d7ffcdae0000</link>
      <description>According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, the two teams will also swap late-round picks in 2027 to complete the deal. Robinson became expendable following the emergence of rookie second-rounder Aireontae Ersery, who has been locked in as the team’s starting left tackle since Week 2, while Robinson hasn’t played an offensive snap since Week 1. Robinson’s arrival in Cleveland gives them an immediate option to start at right tackle in place of Jack Conklin, who has missed three straight games, while also providing them with added depth at both tackle spots once Conklin returns.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes Lions CB D.J. Reed could be “a candidate for injured reserve” after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 4’s win over the Browns.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9604-dca3-a9fb-bf9d1df40000</link>
      <description>Reed was carted from the field in Week 4’s victory, and could end up missing at least four games if placed on injured reserve. A key piece of the Lions defense, Reed has already logged 212 defensive snaps through four weeks, per PFF, and has one interception and two pass breakups on his 2025 resumé. We’ll likely get more clarity on Reed’s injury later in the week, but his absence would be a serious loss for the Lions, who continue to battle injuries to their defense.</description>

      <title>Malik Nabers suffered a torn ACL in the Giants’ Week 4 win over the Chargers, ending his season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-960a-deb6-a7fd-d7dfd8ce0000</link>
      <description>The worst was confirmed early Monday morning, as Nabers, one of the league’s top talents at receiver, will now miss the rest of the season. Nabers is just the latest victim to fall victim to the turf at MetLife Stadium, as his season now ends with an 18-271-2 line on 35 targets. The second-year receiver was on an early place to replicate his rookie campaign numbers when he ripped off 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns on 109 receptions, and will be 23 at the start of next season. Assuming all goes well with his recovery, Nabers should remain a first-round draft pick in 2026 fantasy drafts and could be in line for a career year if Jaxson Dart pans out at quarterback.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport believes Lions CB Terrion Arnold’s Week 5 status could be at risk of missing Week 5’s game against the Bengals after suffering a shoulder injury in Week 4.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000199-9606-deb6-a7fd-d7df36230000</link>
      <description>Arnold is one of two starting corners the Lions could be without in Week 5, as D.J. Reed also suffered a hamstring injury in Sunday’s victory and could be an IR candidate. Arnold has seemingly battled through one injury after another since entering the league last season as the No. 24 overall pick, but has been active for all four games this season. Arnold’s injury is not believed to be too serious, so if he were to miss time, he could just be looking at a one-game absence. His status will be one to monitor when injury reports are released on Wednesday.</description>
