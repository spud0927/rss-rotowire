      <title>The Athletic’s Doug Haller believes James Conner could be a potential cap casualty for the Cardinals this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6769-d042-afbc-7ffb40fa0000</link>
      <description>This doesn’t come as much of a surprise. Conner will be 31 at the start of next season and missed most of 2025 with a season-ending foot/ankle injury he suffered in Week 3. Releasing Conner would save the Cardinals $8 million against the cap in 2026, and would carry a dead cap hit of just $2.250 million if he’s released as a pre-June 1 cut. Conner rushed 32 times for 95 yards and a touchdown last season while also catching eight passes for 38 yards and another score. With his best days likely behind him, Conner would be an uninspiring fantasy lead back wherever he plays next season. It is possible he finds a situation good enough to land in the Zero RB ranks.</description>

      <title>Browns hired Falcons defensive pass game coordinator Mike Rutenberg as defensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6771-d990-a1de-6f7f62f70000</link>
      <description>Rutenberg was one of three finalists for the job and now lands his first defensive coordinator role in the NFL. The longtime coach had previous stints with the 49ers (2020) and Jets (2021-2024), and helped lead a secondary that ranked 13th in passing yards allowed and 13th in net yards per attempt, while also ranking sixth in interceptions. Rutenberg will have big shoes to fill taking over for Jim Schwartz, who resigned after being passed over for the Browns’ head coaching job earlier this offseason.</description>

      <title>Browns S Ronnie Hickman suffered minor injuries in an assault on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6824-d042-afbc-7df674660000</link>
      <description>According to an article published by the New York Post, Hickman was jumped by a group of four men in the lobby of a Manhattan hotel early Monday. The safety was reportedly taken to the hospital and has since been released, with no arrests made in the incident yet. This doesn’t sound like something that will affect Hickman moving into next season. In 2025, the third-year safety totaled 103 tackles, seven pass breakups, and two interceptions with the Browns after being named a full-time starter.</description>

      <title>Tyreek Hill’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said Hill wants to continue playing once he is fully recovered from his knee injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6854-d89c-a1be-efdfdd1a0000</link>
      <description>Speaking onSports Extrawith Josh Moser, Rosenhaus said Hill is “progressing well” in his recovery and intends continue his playing career. Hill, 31, was released by the Dolphins after four seasons with the team, and still has a lot to overcome after suffering a dislocated knee and torn ACL last season, and is not a lock to be ready to go come training camp. If he does intend to play, teams could opt to bring him in and continue to work with him through rehab until he is up to speed, but it seems unlikely Hill would get more than a one-year deal given his age and current injury status. When healthy, Hill still has plenty to offer a team in need of an explosive playmaker, and could see several contenders line up for his services in the coming months.</description>

      <title>JoeBucsFan.com reports Bucky Irving underwent offseason shoulder surgery.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-685b-d990-a1de-6c5f90ae0000</link>
      <description>According to the site, Irving’s “recovery and rehab are not expected to significantly impact his offseason preparation.” Irving missed multiple games due to a foot and shoulder injury last season, but it was the shoulder injury that kept him sidelined until his return in Week 13. With Rachaad White likely leaving via free agency, Irving could be in line for a bell cow role for the Bucs in 2026. The third-year back rushed for 173-588-1 last season but averaged 20.3 touches per game when active. Hopefully a full offseason to recover will have him back to his rookie form after his efficiency numbers dwindled late last season.</description>

      <title>Raiders hired former Titans run game coordinator Travis Smith to be their next defensive line coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-692b-d89c-a1be-efffda6e0000</link>
      <description>The Raiders continue to round out their new-look coaching ranks as they bring in former Titans run game coordinator Travis Smith to serve as their defensive line coach. Smith coached with the Raiders from 2012 to 2021 in multiple capacities, most recently serving as their assistant defensive line coach before stints with the Bears and Titans. Most notably, Smith served as the defensive line coach for the Bears between 2022 and 2024.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Seahawks are “unlikely” to use the franchise tag on RB Ken Walker.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6bd9-d990-a1de-6fdf650f0000</link>
      <description>Retaining other free agents and signing Jaxon Smith-Njigba to a new mega-deal are the Seattle’s priorities this offseason. They’ll likely let Walker, Super Bowl MVP who propelled the Seahawks to a championship this season, explore free agency in the coming months. Walker will have a range of suitors, including teams that will surely be willing to make him a clearcut lead back after Walker shared the workload with the ultra-inefficient Zach Charbonnet in 2024 and 2025. Look for Walker to get a huge deal — as far as running back contracts go — from a team ready to make him the centerpiece of their offense. Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio said the Seahawks front office might “believe that Walker won’t get what he’s looking for on the open market” and make a run at bringing him back to Seattle on a short-term deal.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zack Rosenblatt believes the Jets will “probably” use the franchise tag on RB Breece Hall.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6be8-d629-a1bc-fbfd95640000</link>
      <description>Rosenblatt added that “it feels likely that the Jets slap Hall with the non-exclusive franchise tag or the transition tag and then figure something out from there.” Hall is among the players likely to be tagged in the coming weeks to prevent him from exploring free agency and leaving a Jets team from which he has grown distant in recent years. Last year after the Jets completed a fire sale of their top players, Hall’s social media posts strongly implied he wanted out of New York. Rosenblatt said it’s “notable that in a year in which Hall surpassed 1,000 rushing yards — the first time a Jet has done that since 2015 — he did not win Team MVP, an award voted on by his teammates.” Hall, who will be 25 in May, has averaged 60.7 rushing yards per game and 29.4 receiving yards over 56 appearances for the Jets since 2022. Last year he notched a career high receiving success rate. He eclipsed 100 rushing yards in just four games.</description>

      <title>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer reports the Raiders wanted a head coach who “mirrored” Tom Brady’s leadership qualities.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6c19-d990-a1de-6c5f37450000</link>
      <description>Brady, an announcer for Fox Sports, was very much involved in the team’s search for a new head coach after the Raiders fired Pete Carroll after one season. They landed on former Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, who apparently, like Brady, is “hard-working,” creating “a high level of accountability and discipline, and could lead. And the leadership part didn’t necessarily mean the guy had to be a wake-up-the-echoes speaker.” That the Raiders are building the team in Brady’s image is no surprise given hi success over 23 NFL seasons. That Brady is so intimately involved with shaping an NFL franchise while working as an announcer is another issue entirely.</description>

      <title>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer believes Giants offensive coordinator Matt Nagy will be able to maximize QB Jaxson Dart’s skillset.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-6c39-d629-a1bc-fc3def630000</link>
      <description>Nagy landed with John Harbaugh’s team after three years as the Chiefs’ offensive coordinator and will now be charged with developing Dart in his second pro season. “When I think of Nagy with Jaxson Dart, I think of the spectacular season the new OC helped Alex Smith put together in 2017, with so many spread-offense elements baked in not just to maximize Smith but to develop Patrick Mahomes,” Breer said. “All the movement stuff the Chiefs were doing that year, in theory, should apply organically to Dart’s physical skill.” Kansas City ranked tenth in both offensive success rate and EPA per play over Nagy’s three seasons as OC. They were in line with the Dolphins and Seahawks in drop back EPA with Mahomes at the helm.</description>
