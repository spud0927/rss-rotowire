      <title>Raiders coach Pete Carroll said Geno Smith (shoulder/back) will start against the Texans in Week 16.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-388a-d35e-a1bf-7dca4def0000</link>
      <description>Sugar, we’re going down swinging. Smith will be a backend QB2/QB3 in superflex leagues against the Texans defense. He was practicing in full ahead of Friday, and we’re going to assume he had no setbacks based on this statement. Carroll said that Smith would be the starter for the remainder of the season as well.</description>

      <title>Rams coach Sean McVay said Davante Adams (hamstring) will “most likely not play” against the Falcons in Week 17.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-38a6-d35e-a1bf-7de66c660000</link>
      <description>It profiles as another smash week for Puka Nacua, who took advantage of Adams’ absence with 200 yards through the air in Week 16. The Rams will probably do just fine on offense given what they did against the league-best Seahawks defense on Thursday night. Still, it does cap a bit of Matthew Stafford’s touchdown upside for Week 17 to be without his goal line back.</description>

      <title>Broncos RB Rj Harvey (ribs) is not on Denver’s final Week 16 injury report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-38a8-dc7a-af9b-ffbfaff40000</link>
      <description>He practiced in full all week and should be regarded as a solid RB2 against the Jaguars in Week 16’s Sunday action. Harvey hasn’t shown as much upside as we hoped in the box score so far, but his touchdown equity has come through for a strong Broncos team.</description>

      <title>Rams coach Sean McVay said G Kevin Dotson (ankle) is “doubtful” for Week 17.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-38aa-d35e-a1bf-7dea51140000</link>
      <description>He suffered an ankle sprain, and the fact that McVay is already grim on his chances to play in Week 17 doesn’t color his rest of season output with a rosy picture. Justin Dedich took over in the first quarter and seems likely to be Los Angeles’ starter in the coming weeks.</description>

      <title>Raiders EDGE Maxx Crosby (knee) is not on Las Vegas’ final Week 16 injury report.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-38b8-da28-afbb-fcfd9a990000</link>
      <description>Crosby, as usual, will be Las Vegas’ main defensive weapon against the Texans. IDP leaguers should note that he stands a good chance of wrecking shop against a weak Texans offensive line. Crosby continues to be given days off ahead of games as this going-nowhere season winds down for the Raiders.</description>

      <title>Texans RB Woody Marks (ankle) is questionable for Houston’s Week 16 game against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-38ba-da28-afbb-fcffc0fe0000</link>
      <description>It’s an aggressive listing based on one limited practice, one that perhaps augurs that the Texans are just managing Marks through some existing injuries that they know are going to be tough to overcome in-season. If Marks starts, he’ll be a high-end RB2 against the Raiders. If not, Jawhar Jordan will be a worthwhile plug-and-play starter in Week 16.</description>

      <title>Texans RB Nick Chubb (ribs) is questionable for Houston’s Week 16 game against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-38bc-d35e-a1bf-7dfe5b320000</link>
      <description>It’s a curious questionable tag since Chubb got in two full sessions on Thursday and Friday — several backs with that workload would be off the injury report entirely. Chubb could be a worthwhile FLEX play against the Raiders depending on who is active at 3 ET, but odds are he’ll probably split the workload with Jawhar Jordan if he is up and Woody Marks (ankle) is down.</description>

      <title>Texans CB Derek Stingley (oblique) is questionable for Houston’s Week 16 game against the Raiders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-38be-d35e-a1bf-7dfe1b830000</link>
      <description>He got in a limited session to get on to the questionable line after missing Wednesday and Thursday practice. Azeez Al-Shaair was limited on Thursday, but did not participate in Wednesday or Friday practice for the Texans. Both players should be considered true question marks for Week 16’s action against the Raiders.</description>

      <title>49ers WR Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) did not practice on Friday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-38e4-da28-afbb-fcfd96780000</link>
      <description>49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan initially said he expects Pearsall “to be alright.” He followed that statement up on Monday by saying “there is a concern” about Pearsall’s injuries. On Thursday, he said there is a “possibility” Pearsall plays on Monday night. This is nothing new. Return timelines have been all over the place with this team. Even if he does play, he will do so at less than 100.0 percent. Make a backup plan.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports that the Bears plan to activate LB Tremaine Edmunds (groin) from injured reserve before Week 16 against the Packers.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-3928-d35e-a1bf-7dea71d00000</link>
      <description>That’s great. Edmunds has not played since Week 11, but he still leads the team with 67 tackles. He has also recorded eight quarterback pressures, two sacks, two pass breakups and four interceptions. Getting him back is a big deal. The Packers (9-4-1) face the Bears (10-4) on Saturday.</description>
