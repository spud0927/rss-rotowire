      <title>Lions WR Isaac TeSlaa (hand) was limited in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bd0b-d90e-a9da-bf0f873e0000</link>
      <description>TeSlaa would seem to be the beneficiary if Kalif Raymond (ankle, DNP for second day in a row) can’t go on Thursday. No need to rush the rookie wideout into your lineups as he has yet to do better than one catch in a game this year, but perhaps he’ll be a worthwhile monitor on Thursday with an eye towards the rest of the season.</description>

      <title>Packers RB Josh Jacobs (knee) was limited in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bd38-d6c4-abfb-ff3b97b30000</link>
      <description>We haven’t heard anything concerning about Jacobs’ chances of playing in Week 13 to this point. He certainly seems to be trending towards playing, though Wednesday’s status report will tell the full tale. Jacobs has practiced on a limited basis for four consecutive days dating back towards last week, and as long as he has his full range of motion, we expect to see him out there.</description>

      <title>Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said “you’ll find out Thursday” when asked if WR Jayden Reed (foot/shoulder) plays Thanksgiving day against the Lions.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bd41-d82c-a79a-bfd57c7b0000</link>
      <description>Reed logged a limited practice participation for the Packers’ walkthrough practice on Tuesday. He just returned to practice last week after spending the bulk of the season on injured reserve and has yet to get in a full practice. The Packers list Reed with both the foot and shoulder/collarbone issues that ailed him this season. It’s still difficult to see Reed playing against the Lions on Thanksgiving, but LaFleur said, “You never know... you’ll find out Thursday.” Reed is inching his way back and his final status after Wednesday’s practice will provide more clarity on if he plays Thursday.</description>

      <title>Seahawks waived CB Derion Kendrick.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bd53-d90e-a9da-bf5fd9f40000</link>
      <description>Kendrick joined the Seahawks in August after the Rams cut him in the final wave of roster cuts. He was a sixth-round pick of the Rams in 2022 and had a fruitful 2023 season, starting 12 games and tallying one interception and 10 passes defended. Kendrick had two interceptions and five passes defended with the Seahawks this year, but now heads to waivers.</description>

      <title>Eagles WR DeVonta Smith (shoulder/chest) did not participate in Tuesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bdb0-db57-afda-ffb2f6ed0000</link>
      <description>Smith took some hard hits and falls in the Eagles’ Week 12 loss to the Cowboys and starts out the week as a non-participant in the team’s Tuesday walkthrough. The Eagles play the Bears on Friday, so Smith’s DNP to start the week is concerning for his game status. Fantasy managers should check back throughout the week; any sort of practice time would be a positive sign for Smith playing in Week 13. WR Xavier Gipson (shoulder) was also a DNP after he was shaken up on a punt return that he fumbled late in Week 12. Jahan Dotson would be next up for targets if Smith cannot go.</description>

      <title>Eagles RB Saquon Barkley (groin) was limited in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bdb9-db57-afda-ffbb823f0000</link>
      <description>Barkley was listed as a limited participant for the Eagles’ walkthrough. It wasn’t a full practice with pads, so we wouldn’t put too much stock into a limited first practice on a short week. Fantasy managers can expect Barkley to still practice throughout the week and play Friday against the Bears, barring setbacks.</description>

      <title>Eagles EDGE Brandon Graham (groin) did not participate in Tuesday’s walkthrough.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bdc7-d82c-a79a-bfd712710000</link>
      <description>Graham opens the Eagles’ short week not participating in the team’s walkthrough. The 37-year-old re-joined the Eagles last month and has been playing in the pass rush rotation. He is now a bit banged up as the Eagles play the Bears on Friday. Graham will likely play if he can practice later in the week, Eagles fans should stay tuned for his participation reports to see if he can play in Week 13.</description>

      <title>Ravens WR Rashod Bateman (ankle) and S Kyle Hamilton (shoulder) were limited in Tuesday’s practice after initially announced to be full participants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bdcd-db57-afda-ffff2e6b0000</link>
      <description>Head coach John Harbaugh had announced both Bateman and Hamilton to be full participants on Tuesday, but the team’s official injury report has them listed as limited participants. It’s not the first time Harbaugh and the Ravens have had discrepancies in practice reporting, but we’ll take the official limited listing as the truth for now. Bateman opens the week with back-to-back limited practices and has a shot to return to his starting role on Thanksgiving against the Bengals. Meanwhile, Hamilton has played through injuries before and we would not rule out the same happening again this week.</description>

      <title>Ravens RB Justice Hill (neck) did not participate in Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bdd1-d90e-a9da-bfdffc0c0000</link>
      <description>Hill pops up on the injury report with a neck issue. It is presumably new, given he was not on the injury report Monday. A new neck injury is cause for concern in terms of game status and Hill is in jeopardy of missing the Ravens’ Thanksgiving game against the Bengals. If he does miss, Keaton Mitchell will get a bump in pass-catching duties.</description>

      <title>Broncos signed C Luke Wattenberg to a four-year, $48 million contract extension.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-bdd4-d6c4-abfb-ffd78f2f0000</link>
      <description>NFL Network’sTom Pelisseroalso reports Wattenberg’s extension also includes $27 million guaranteed. The 28-year-old has been an anchor of the Broncos’ offensive line, starting all 24 games played over the last two seasons. He ranks among the top-15 centers in both PFF pass blocking and run blocking grades, allowing one quarterback hit and nine hurries this season. Wattenberg gets rewarded with a deal that keeps him in Denver through 2029.</description>
