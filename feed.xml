      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports Patriots owner Robert Kraft was not voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on the first ballot.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-23a2-d89c-a1be-afff00a40000</link>
      <description>Like Bill Belichick before him, Kraft will be kept out of Canton for at least a year. Unlike Belichick, it’s not clear that there was a concerted effort to keep Kraft out, though it’s still a puzzling decision by the voters. Kraft bought the team in 1994. Including Sunday’s upcoming game, they have gone on to appear in 11 Super Bowls with six wins under Kraft. A victory over the Seahawks would put New England in sole possession of the league record for Lombardi Trophies, all of which have come under Kraft. New England drafted the greatest quarterback of all time and hired the greatest coach of all time early in Kraft’s tenure as the principal owner. Their dynasty defined football in the 21st century. And yet, neither Kraft nor Belichick is in the Hall of Fame. Curious.</description>

      <title>Giants hired former Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy as their offensive coordinator.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2403-d042-afbc-7dd38df20000</link>
      <description>Nagy never worked directly with Harbaugh, but Schefter notes that Harbaugh coached under Andy Reid, who has been somewhat of a mentor to Nagy. The two have spent well over a decade together between Philadelphia and Kansas City. Reid even stumped for Nagy as a head coach this offseason. On the other hand, he just replaced Nagy, whose contract was up, with Eric Bieniemy as the team’s offensive coordinator. Nagy just spent three years in Kansas City and the team never finished better than 15th in points per game. Defenses have changed to stop teams like the Chiefs specifically, but the results speak for themselves. Perhaps the change of scenery will inject some creativity into Nagy’s offense, but we aren’t holding our breath.</description>

      <title>Bears requested an interview with Cardinals pass game specialist Connor Senger for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2412-d89c-a1be-afdfced50000</link>
      <description>Baltimore poached Bears OC Declan Doyle for the same role, leaving Ben Johnson in need of a new right-hand man. Senger spent a few years as a coach in the lower levels of college football before joining the Cardinals for four seasons. He was promoted to passing game coordinator in 2025. The Cardinals finished the season seventh in passing yards per game, though they sat at 20th in EPA per play. Senger would be a surprising hire, but Johnson’s immediate success in Chicago has earned him the right to make unconventional hires.</description>

      <title>Jordan Schultz reports Saints QBs coach Scott Tolzien plans to stay with the team after interviewing for the Steelers’ offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-241b-d042-afbc-7ddb97a80000</link>
      <description>Per Schultz, Tolzien was considered a top candidate for the Steelers’ OC job under new head coach Mike McCarthy. Instead, he will stay with the Saints, helping to mentor Tyler Shough in his second season. While an OC gig would certainly hasten Tolzien’s rise toward a head coaching job, he has a great setup in New Orleans at the moment. Shough looks like a surprising hit at quarterback and Kellen Moore is a great coach to learn the ropes of calling an NFL offense under. If things go well for the Saints in 2026, Tolzien should get to choose his spot as an OC next year.</description>

      <title>CBS Sports’ Jonathan Jones reports Bengals WRs coach Troy Walters declined to interview for the Bears’ offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-2442-d355-a5bd-af56cdab0000</link>
      <description>Walters has received several OC interviews over the years. He would not call the plays in Chicago and currently works with the best wide receiver duo in the NFL, so he is understandably staying in Cincinnati for the time being. Walters has been with the Bengals since 2020.</description>

      <title>Browns head coach Todd Monken said it’s “TBD” if Shedeur Sanders will start for the Browns next season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-24a6-d629-a1bc-b4bff72c0000</link>
      <description>He added that he’s “absolutely excited” to coach Sanders and the other Browns offensive quarterbacks. We’re not sure who else the Browns would bring in between a draft board that looks very iffy after the Raiders select Fernando Mendoza at No. 1 overall and a free-agency class at the position that looks depleted after Malik Willis. We’d give Sanders good odds of being the Week 1 starter here, but it’s clear the Browns are going to at least make him earn it.</description>

      <title>Browns coach Todd Monken said he will call plays on offense.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-249e-d355-a5bd-afde740d0000</link>
      <description>Monken brought former Ravens run game coordinator Travis Switzer on board as his OC. Switzer has never called plays at any level, so this news shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Calling plays in Baltimore over the past three seasons, the Ravens finished fourth, third, and 11th in points per game. Monken has a proven trackrecord of success with an MVP-caliber quarterback. How he fares with the Browns’ messy quarterback situation will determine his fate in Cleveland.</description>

      <title>Ravens signed former Broncos OC Joe Lombardi as a senior offensive assistant.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-24ab-d89c-a1be-afff12d70000</link>
      <description>He’ll be the steadying hand for Declan Doyle as the youngster calls plays for the Ravens. Lombardi was fired so late in the cycle that he had no real shot at an offensive coordinator job in this cycle. We suspect he’ll get interviews in 2027.</description>

      <title>Steelers will interview Vikings passing game coordinator and TEs coach Brian Angelichio for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-24b1-d042-afbc-7df3d73a0000</link>
      <description>As has been the norm in Mike McCarthy’s searches this offseason, Angelichio coached under McCarthy in Green Bay. He’s a long-time NFL tight ends coach who has worked with the Buccaneers, Browns, Commanders, and Panthers in addition to the Vikings and Packers. Angelichio has not called plays since he was the offensive coordinator at (wait for it) Ithaca College in the early 2000s, but he wouldn’t have that pressure with the Steelers as McCarthy is expected to call plays.</description>

      <title>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer reports Texans secondary coach Dino Vasso is a “name of interest” for the Cardinals defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-24d4-d629-a1bc-b4dd2a8a0000</link>
      <description>Vasso also interviewed for the Titans DC job before it went to Gus Bradley. Breer adds Rams assistant head coach Aubrey Pleasant is a possibility for the job. As one of the last teams to fill their head coaching vacancy, the Cardinals are going to be left trying to find up-and-comers for their coordinator positions.</description>
