      <title>Rams TE Terrance Ferguson (hamstring) did not participate in Tuesday’s walkthrough practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-959f-d56e-afff-f7ff24960000</link>
      <description>Ferguson sat out Week 18 after being a late addition to the injury report with a hamstring injury. He starts out the week listed as DNP as the Rams held a walkthrough on Tuesday. Also DNP were WR Jordan Whittington (knee) and OL Kevin Dotson (ankle). The Rams’ key offensive players will have a few days to practice ahead of a Saturday Wild Card showdown against the Panthers.</description>

      <title>Rams WR Davante Adams (hamstring) was listed as a full participant for Tuesday’s practice.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-95a8-d35e-a1bf-d5ea9e930000</link>
      <description>Rams head coach Sean McVay has already said Adams is expected to play in the team’s Wild Card matchup against the Panthers Saturday. The Rams only held a walkthrough Tuesday, but the estimation that Adams would be a full practice participant is good news. The veteran sat out the last few games of the regular season since aggravating his hamstring injury in Week 15 but the Rams will get their goal-line target back for the playoffs.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reports the Cardinals have requested to interview Patriots pass game coordinator Thomas Brown for their head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-95ac-d35e-a1bf-d5ee07bc0000</link>
      <description>Brown spent the 2025 season as the Patriots’ passing game coordinator and helped build a thriving offense around MVP candidate Drake Maye. The 39-year-old was an interim head coach for the Bears in 2024 and has had multiple roles with Sean McVay and the Rams from 2020-2022. Brown is now back on the head coaching radar, with Arizona first to come calling with an interview request.</description>

      <title>Browns beat writer Mary Kay Cabot reports the Browns have requested to interview Seahawks defensive coordinator Aden Durde for their head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-95b0-dc7a-af9b-dfbf1f630000</link>
      <description>Durde joined the Seahawks as defensive coordinator for Mike Macdonald in 2024. Seattle finished the 2025 regular season posting the best defensive DVOA in the league and has had two successful defensive seasons under Macdonald and Durde. Though Macdonald is the prevailing defensive mind in Seattle, Durde still gets some of the credit for the No. 1 seed Seahawks and will get a chance to interview for a head coaching spot with the Browns and call his own defense.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports former Ravens head coach John Harbaugh is “expected to emerge as a favorite” for the Giants’ head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-95b6-dc7a-af9b-dfbfe5d70000</link>
      <description>As expected, Harbaugh is the top head coaching candidate on the market just moments after his firing. The Giants have been looking for a head coach since firing Brian Daboll midseason and now Schefter reports Harbaugh is expected to be the favorite for their open position. Schefter also reports that seven teams called Harbaugh’s agent, Bryan Harlan, with interest in hiring him within moments of his firing. Suffice to say, Harbaugh is a hot candidate on the head coaching market and the Giants are immediately a team to watch in the coming weeks.</description>

      <title>Ohio State WR Carnell Tate has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-95f4-d968-a19b-ddf5a5320000</link>
      <description>Tate is projected to be one of the draft’s top wide receiver prospects, foregoing his final season of eligibility to declare early out of Ohio State. He accomplished a sophomore year of 52 receptions for 733 yards and four touchdowns, following it up with a 51/875/9 line his junior year. Tate crossed the 100-yard mark in four games in 2025 as the Buckeyes’ No. 2 wide receiver and will now enter the draft early to first-round buzz.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports the Raiders requested to interview Broncos quarterbacks coach Davis Webb for their head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-963a-dc7a-af9b-dfbff1060000</link>
      <description>Webb is a former 2017 third-round pick who started one game in 2022 before the Broncos hired him as quarterbacks coach in 2023 under Sean Payton. He also held the role of passing game coordinator for the 2025 season. Webb’s role in developing Bo Nix through the first two years of his career explain the Raiders’ interest in him; Vegas has a quarterback likely on the way with the No. 1 overall pick. The Raiders await the opportunity to interview Webb for their head coaching job amidst the Broncos’ playoff run.</description>

      <title>Giants will interview former Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy for the team’s head coaching vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-9881-d968-a19b-d8f1f8580000</link>
      <description>McCarthy last coached the Cowboys in 2024 and has made the postseason in 12 of 18 seasons as an NFL head coach in Dallas and Green Bay. With a history of quarterback development and a QB-friendly offensive system, McCarthy would be a natural choice to develop Jaxson Dart as he enters his second NFL season. McCarthy, who has won 61 percent of his games as an NFL head coach along with 11 postseason contests, would likely be a short-term option for the Giants, one who could stabilize the situation around Dart and give him a chance to establish himself as a high-end NFL starter.</description>

      <title>The Baltimore Sun’s Brian Wacker reports former Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury and Chargers DC Jesse Minter are among the candidates to be the Ravens’ next head coach.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019b-989a-d56e-afff-fefa9d1d0000</link>
      <description>Kingsbury, who mutually parted ways with the Commanders on Tuesday, will apparently have his choice of head coaching gigs, with the Titans and Giants lining up to interview him. Kingsbury would be an interesting fit with Lamar Jackson; he has plenty of experience coaching dual-threat QBs over his years in Arizona and Washington. Minter, meanwhile, would be the natural choice if the team is committed to getting back to its tough-nosed defensive roots. Wacker also mentioned Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, who would seem to be a long shot for the job.</description>
