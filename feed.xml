      <title>Chargers hired Western Michigan DC Chris O’Leary to the same position.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-003e-dc7a-af9f-cfbf6e450000</link>
      <description>If that seems random, it’s less so than it appears on the surface, as O’Leary served as the Bolts’ safeties coach in 2024. O’Leary apparently earned internal raves for his 2024 work with Derwin James, then went on to coordinator one of the nation’s best scoring defenses at Western Michigan. Before his Chargers and WMU stops, O’Leary spent six seasons at Notre Dame. It’s a somewhat outside-the-box hire, but a seemingly good one for a team tasked with replacing Jesse Minter.</description>

      <title>Ravens requested an interview with Broncos defensive passing game coordinator and assistant head coach Jim Leonhard for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0688-db99-adfc-26daae330000</link>
      <description>Leonhard was an NFL safety for 10 years, including a season with the Ravens, before becoming a coach. He coached college ball, primarily at Wisconsin, for eight years before joining the Broncos. With Denver’s defense emerging as one of the league’s best units over the past two seasons, Leonhard now has multiple teams reaching out to him about their defensive coordinator vacancies. He also has an interview with the Bills lined up. Leonhard would join Jesse Minter, another rising star among defensive coaches, if he lands the Baltimore job.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports Commanders defensive pass game coordinator Jason Simmons will join the Steelers “in a prominent defensive role.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-09ea-d452-afdd-fffb6fdb0000</link>
      <description>Simmons originally interviewed for the Steelers’ defensive coordinator vacancy, but that role went to Patrick Graham. Now Simmons will reunite with Graham and head coach Mike McCarthy. Simmons got his start as a coach in Green Bay and wound up spending nearly a decade there. He has since held the title of defensive pass game coordinator for the Panthers, Raiders, and Commanders.</description>

      <title>Josh Allen wore a boot on his right foot and used crutches while at Joe Brady’s introductory press conference.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0abb-d355-a5bd-8fff8e4d0000</link>
      <description>Bills GM Brandon Beane told reporters last week that Allen might undergo offseason foot surgery. He suffered the foot injury in Week 16 but played through it, seemingly without issue, through the team’s playoff run. Allen, however, is no stranger to gritting his teeth through injuries, so it may have been a bigger deal than his play let on. Either way, the extra medical equipment he was sporting today suggests an offseason surgery is definitely on the table.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Jeremely Fowler reports one candidate for the Raiders’ head coaching vacancy predicted, “it’s probably (Kubiak’s) job to lose.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0ac7-dead-af9e-6ec71cfb0000</link>
      <description>Per Fowler, the Raiders are interviewing Klint Kubiak this weekend and will then make their final decision for their head coaching vacancy. Vegas has spent its top two picks in each of the past two drafts on offensive players. They are also about to spend the No. 1 overall pick on Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza. The team is built around offensive cornerstones and Kubiak is one of the hottest offensive-minded head coaching candidates on the market. Barring a last-second twist, all signs point to Kubiak getting this job.</description>

      <title>Steelers will interview Raiders DC Patrick Graham for their defensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0aea-dfd7-a5dc-0febb7f10000</link>
      <description>Graham is currently on his way to Pittsburgh. ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reports that “the expectation in some league circles” is that Graham will get the gig “if all goes well.” He previously interviewed for the Dolphins head-coaching vacancy and has been linked to the Commanders’ defensive coordinator vacancy as well.</description>

      <title>Bills QB Josh Allen confirmed that he underwent surgery to repair a broken bone in his foot on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0afc-dfd7-a5dc-0fff3aab0000</link>
      <description>Allen revealed that he aggravated an “older injury” against the Browns in Week 16. It was a fracture in his fifth metatarsal. To correct the issue, doctors “went in, took it out and cleaned it up.” Yuck. Allen adds that he would “figure out” a way to play if the Bills had a game this week, and he will be ready to participate in organized team activities in May.</description>

      <title>Steelers requested an interview with Saints QB coach Scott Tolzien for their offensive coordinator vacancy.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0afd-d355-a5bd-8ffd8fb50001</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler notes that Tolzien was on the Packers’ roster, as a quarterback, under current Steelers head coach Mike McCarthy. McCarthy also hired Tolzien as an offensive assistant with the Cowboys in 2020 and promoted him to quarterbacks coach in 2023, where he served for two seasons.</description>

      <title>Ravens head coach Jesse Minter will call defensive plays</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b19-dead-af9e-6f9f81300000</link>
      <description>This makes sense. Minter was hired, in part, for his defensive prowess, having served as a long-time Jim Harbaugh understudy. The Ravens’ defensive coordinator has not yet been hired. Learning under Minter without having play-calling responsibilities could be appealing for some.</description>

      <title>Bills TE Dalton Kincaid (knee) said he is “feeling good” and “does not anticipate” undergoing surgery this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-0b20-dfd7-a5dc-0f6377790000</link>
      <description>Kincaid confirmed that he played through the 2025 season with a torn PCL, which he initially injured in 2024. Per Kincaid, he “continued to tweak it in different situations” this season. The fact that he plans to avoid surgery is somewhat surprising after spending a year rehabbing the torn ligament unsuccessfully. Hopefully things work out better this time.</description>
