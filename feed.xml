      <title>Tetairoa McMillan was named Offensive Rookie of the Year.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-30c1-d042-afbc-7dd390310000</link>
      <description>McMillan caught 70-of-120 targets for 1,014 yards and seven touchdowns this season, leading all NFL rookies in the latter two categories. The Panthers’ promising youngster proved himself as an NFL-ready No. 1 wide receiver. He is primed for another big outing in 2026.</description>

      <title>Joe Thuney was named Protector of the Year.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-30cc-d629-a1bc-b0dd91e60000</link>
      <description>Thuney wins the NFL’s inaugural offensive linemen award in his first season with the Bears, who acquired him in exchange for a 2026 fourth-round draft pick in March 2025. Although the left tackle position remains one of the most important positions in football, Thuney, a left guard, winning the award proves that Protector of the Year will not simply be handed to the NFL’s best left tackle.</description>

      <title>Christian McCaffrey was named the 2025 Associated Press NFL Comeback Player of the Year.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-30cf-d89c-a1be-bfdf22d90000</link>
      <description>McCaffrey astonishingly handled a career-high 413 touches in his age-29 season, totaling 102 receptions, 2,126 scrimmage yards and 17 touchdowns. To say he deserves this award is an understatement. He notably won the Offensive Player of the Year award in 2023.</description>

      <title>Mike Vrabel was named NFL Coach of the Year.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-30dd-d355-a5bd-bfdd1b370000</link>
      <description>The Patriots finished with a 4-13 record one year ago. Now, in Vrabel’s first season as head coach, they are preparing to play in Super Bowl LX against the Seahawks following a 14-3 season. Patriots OC Josh McDaniels was named Assistant Coach of the Year earlier this evening.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Charlotte Carroll reports that the Giants are “bringing on Greg Roman to the staff.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-30ea-d355-a5bd-bffe96630000</link>
      <description>The move reunites him with Giants head coach John Harbaugh. Roman previously served as Harbaugh’s offensive coordinator with the Ravens from 2019-2022. He served as the Chargers’ offensive coordinator under head coach Jim Harbaugh over the last two seasons. Per Carroll, Roman’s role will be on the offensive side of the ball.</description>

      <title>Jaxon Smith-Njigba was named Offensive Player of the Year.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-30dc-d355-a5bd-bfdc6ad90000</link>
      <description>Smith-Njigba put together an extremely impressive stat line in his third NFL season, catching 119-of-163 targets for 1,793 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also earned first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors this year after blossoming into a true No. 1 wide receiver.</description>

      <title>Matthew Stafford was named the 2025 Associated Press Most Valuable Player.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-3116-d042-afbc-7dd6d7f70000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Adam Schefter notes that this was the closest MVP race since Peyton Manning and Steve McNair shared the award in 2003. Stafford narrowly beat Patriots QB Drake Maye, winning 24 first-place votes to Maye’s 23 while totaling 366 points to Maye’s 361. Stafford closed his acceptance speech by telling the audience he will return for another season in 2026.</description>

      <title>Carson Schwesinger was named Defensive Rookie of the Year.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-311a-d89c-a1be-bfdfa5760000</link>
      <description>Schwesinger notched 156 total tackles, 67 solo tackles, 2.5 sacks, 11 TFLs, three pass breakups and two interceptions despite missing Week 18 with a high-ankle sprain. It was an extremely impressive season for the No. 33 overall pick in last year’s draft.</description>

      <title>Kenneth Walker said “if it was my choice, I’d definitely stay” with the Seahawks when asked about his impending free agency this offseason.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-338e-d042-afbc-7fde71e10000</link>
      <description>Walker is set to be a free agent this offseason and has been highly valuable to the Seahawks during their postseason run to the Super Bowl. Walker has rushed 38 times for 178 yards and four touchdowns for the Seahawks in their two playoff games while catching another seven passes for 70 yards. The knee injury Zach Charbonnet suffered in the team’s Divisional Round win vs. the 49ers is expected to sideline him for the start of next season, which will likely play a role in how aggressive the Seahawks are in re-signing Walker. Speaking with the media earlier in the week, head coach Mike Macdonald also said the team wants Walker back this offseason. We’ll see how quickly a deal gets worked out in the coming months, but there seems to be mutual interest on both sides at this point.</description>

      <title>Malik Nabers said the rehab for his knee injury has been “phenomenal” so far.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-33a2-d629-a1bc-b3bf59ec0000</link>
      <description>This comes from ESPN’s Jordan Raanan, who said Nabers also noted “he did in fact have a full meniscus repair in addition to ACL surgery in October.” This additional surgery will likely extend Nabers’ recovery timeline, but Giants GM Joe Schoen said last month that the team is hopeful Nabers will be ready for the start of training camp. This is already shaping up to be a storyline we will be tracking up to and possibly into camp, depending on how things go in the coming months. Until we get a definite word on when Nabers will return to the field, this injury could depress his ADP and create a little value for the fantasy managers drafting in the early portions of the offseason.</description>
