      <title>Titans CB L’Jarius Sneed (knee) trending toward playing in Week 1 against the the Broncos.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1a4-d332-a1fd-f7b6d26c0000</link>
      <description>Sneed joined the active roster on August 20th after spending nearly one month on the active/physically unable to perform list, so one would hope he is ready to go by Week 1, given the extended absence. Back in May, Titans head coach Brian Callahan acknowledged that Sneed’s balky knee requires management “all the time,” and the veteran cornerback underwent a cleanup procedure in late July. While the Titans would presumably prefer to feature Sneed as a starter, it’s possible the knee issue limits him to a rotational role.</description>

      <title>Free agent WR Hunter Renfrow “has interest from several teams.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1b8-de13-afdc-f7fb128b0000</link>
      <description>Renfrow is reportedly “weighing his options” at this time. We do not expect Renfrow to land a flex-worthy role, entering his age-30 season. Renfrow was sidelined for the entirety of 2024 due to ulcerative colitis. He could help a young quarterback develop, operating in a rotational backup role, though.</description>

      <title>Saints head coach Kellen Moore said LG Trevor Penning (toe) is out of his walking boot.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1c1-dbe3-a9bb-f1d3b8460000</link>
      <description>Moore reportedly did not “have a substantive update on his progress” beyond that. Penning transitioned from offensive tackle to left guard this offseason, after faring well as a run-blocker but struggling as a pass-protector through three NFL seasons. The lost practice reps could hurt his development. His Week 1 status is unknown.</description>

      <title>Bengals waived DT Eric Gregory.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1c7-d332-a1fd-f7f7502c0000</link>
      <description>ESPN’s Ben Baby notes that the Bengals have one practice squad spot remaining. Gregory could be a candidate for it. The Bengals signed OT Javon Foster and S Russ Yeast to the practice squad and released OT Devin Cochran.</description>

      <title>Broncos head coach Sean Payton said Marvin Mims Jr. (groin) will return to practice on Monday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1ce-de13-afdc-f7cffd0f0000</link>
      <description>Courtland Sutton warmed hearts on Sunday, saying Mims had secured the Broncos’ No. 2 wide receiver role. On Wednesday, Mims exited practice with the groin injury. Soft tissue strains can be finicky in the rehab process but ESPN’s Adam Schefter previously reported that the team is “not overly concerned,” so we like Mims’ odds of returning to practice on Monday. He makes for a worthwhile bench stash ahead of what could be a breakout third-year campaign.</description>

      <title>A.J. Brown (hamstring) logged his second consecutive practice on Thursday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1e7-d332-a1fd-f7f76ab90000</link>
      <description>Brown is on track to assume fantasy football WR1 duties against the Cowboys next week. Eagles OG Landon Dickerson logged his second consecutive practice as well, after undergoing a “minor procedure” on his injured meniscus earlier this month. He has a chance to play in Week 1.</description>

      <title>Cardinals signed QB Kedon Slovis.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1f7-d332-a1fd-f7f7273e0000</link>
      <description>Slovis returns to his home state of Arizona after three preseason appearances with the Texans. He completed 27-of-43 passes for 233 yards, one touchdown and one interception and rushed three times for seven yards.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1f7-d332-a1fd-f7f7273e0000</guid>

      <title>49ers signed WR Russell Gage Jr. to a one-year contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f1fe-dbe3-a9bb-f1ff42d40000</link>
      <description>The 49ers bolster their wide receiver depth with availability concerns swirling around Brandon Aiyuk (knee), Jauan Jennings (calf, contract) and Demarcus Robinson (suspension). Gage should not be expected to return flex value in Week 1. The 49ers also released S Richie Grant, while QB Adrian Martinez, RB Sincere McCormick and WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling were signed to the practice squad.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports that “the Cowboys appear willing to at least listen” to trade offers for Micah Parsons.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f205-d332-a1fd-f637ea240000</link>
      <description>Several teams have reportedly spoken with the Cowboys’ front office about a potential trade, and although “no trade is imminent,” the Cowboys “would like to resolve the situation, one way or another, in the coming days.” Many outcomes are possible here. The two sides could resolve their issues. Parsons’ back tightness could flare up again, though he has already been medically cleared via an MRI. He could play out the final year of his contract and then begin the fight anew as the Cowboys threaten to apply the franchise tag, or the Cowboys could choose to jettison one of the NFL’s best EDGE rushers because he refuses to sign an alleged deal averaging $40.5 million per year that was discussed without Parsons’ agent present. ESPN adds that it is unclear “whether Parsons’ agent, David Mulugheta, has been granted permission to speak to teams regarding a contract extension,” which would lend credence to the possibility that Parsons’ Dallas days are numbered. The Cowboys face the Eagles in the NFL’s Thursday Night Football season opener next week.</description>

      <title>Buccaneers GM Jason Licht said Chris Godwin (ankle) is likely to return in return Week 5 or later.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-f22d-db7b-a5dd-f22d161e0000</link>
      <description>This tracks with prior reporting that suggested Godwin is expected to return sometime in October. Although we would love to have him on the field in Week 1, he appears to be on schedule, as far as the team is concerned. Licht also said OT Tristan Wirfs’ (knee) return “might be a little sooner.” It sounds like Baker Mayfield may be without his left tackle for the first 3-4 weeks, in which the Bucs face the Falcons, Texans, Jets and Eagles. All four teams are expected to field capable pass-rush units. Getting Wirfs back in time to face the Eagles’ vaunted group could be the goal.</description>
