      <title>Colts coach Shane Steichen said that it is “hard to say” there’s a future in Indianapolis for Anthony Richardson.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c34f-dbe3-a9bb-f35f45980000</link>
      <description>“Obviously, Daniel (Jones) is our starter right now. And if something happens to Daniel at some point, AR gets another opportunity,” Steichen continued. It’s not exactly a smoking gun statement, but it is damning about Richardson’s chances of playing this season that Steichen couldn’t even give a token pushback on the question. If the Colts truly aren’t married to Richardson, it’s possible that they get a trade offer they can’t refuse at cutdowns for the former No. 4 overall pick.</description>

      <title>Tampa Bay Times’ Rick Stroud reports Jalen McMillan will be placed on injured reserve and could be out “past the Bucs Week 9 bye.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c355-dbe3-a9bb-f35754470000</link>
      <description>We’ve gone from McMillan “avoiding anything major” to him being out half the season through the last two days. McMillan starting on IR will give runway to Emeka Egbuka to be a major contributor to Tampa Bay’s offense immediately. It also may give supporting options like Cade Otton more of a share than they’d normally have as Tampa threads the needle early without McMillan and Chris Godwin. McMillan isn’t a must-hold in shallow leagues based on this reported timeline.</description>

      <title>Jordan Mailata (concussion) did not practice on Wednesday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c375-dbe3-a9bb-f3776afd0000</link>
      <description>Even if he’d been healthy, it’s hard to believe the Eagles would have let Mailata play in the preseason finale anyway. He will probably be fine for Week 1, but brain injuries are no laughing matter and there are a few every season that turn into extended absences. The Eagles will obviously give their star left tackle all the time he needs to recover ahead of the season opener against Dallas.</description>

      <title>Texans released RB J.J. Taylor.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c377-d332-a1fd-d777b2d90000</link>
      <description>Taylor appeared in five games last year, rushing 10 times for 44 yards, and has yet to receiver more than 23 carries in an NFL season. The 27-year-old will look to catch on elsewhere on a practice squad or on the backend of a roster.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c377-d332-a1fd-d777b2d90000</guid>

      <title>49ers placed RB Patrick Taylor (shoulder) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c38d-de13-afdc-c7cff57e0000</link>
      <description>That will end Taylor’s season before it begins — he suffered the shoulder injury in the second week of the preseason. Taylor has been a deep depth piece for the 49ers, drawing 39 carries for 183 yards and a score last year, and San Francisco’s injury woes at the position will continue. This slides Jeff Wilson into a stronger position at the start of the year, perhaps as high as Christian McCaffrey’s backup if Isaac Guerrendo and Jordan James aren’t able to recover from their injuries ahead of Week 1. The 49ers signed Nate Sudfeld to take Taylor’s place on the roster and absorb some punishment in Week 3 of the preseason.</description>

      <title>Indianapolis Star’s Joel A. Erickson reports Tyler Goodson (shoulder) avoided a major injury on Saturday.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c394-dbe3-a9bb-f3d766440000</link>
      <description>Goodson injured his elbow in Indianapolis’ second preseason game on Saturday, but it appears the door will not be cracked for DJ Giddens just yet. At least not via injury, anyway. Goodson hasn’t returned to practice yet but it sounds like he has a decent shot at being available for the opener based on this report.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Paul Dehner believes WR Mitchell Tinsley is making the Bengals 53-man roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c397-db7b-a5dd-e3977ff30000</link>
      <description>Other than the Bengals sad first-team defense, Tinsley was the talk of last night’s preseason game between the Bengals and the Commanders with a 5/73/2 display on six targets, including two extremely nice end zone catches, one from Joe Burrow. Dehner adds that Tinsley’s performance “had him running with the first team during certain practices.” Do we need to scrap the entire depth chart and worry about Ja’Marr Chase’s target share? No. But Tinsley could potentially push Andrei Iosivas for some time in the third receiver role, and perhaps scoot ahead of Jermaine Burton at last cuts.</description>

      <title>Free agent WR Gabe Davis will visit the Bills “this week.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c3b3-d332-a1fd-d7b7c0a20000</link>
      <description>Davis has been this offseason’s most-courted visit, appearing for the Steelers twice, the Giants, the 49ers, and now his old stomping grounds in Buffalo. There’s little to suggest that Davis is going to be a fantasy factor regardless of where he signs this offseason, but at least in Buffalo he’d be able to slide right back into a familiar role.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Jon Machota believe the Cowboys “still need to see more” from DT Mazi Smith for him to make the 53-man roster.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c3b6-db7b-a5dd-e3b683300000</link>
      <description>Smith has played in both preseason games — the Cowboys have sat most of their starters — and he was still on the field in the second half against the Ravens on Saturday. The former first-round pick’s 2024 PFF grade was 208th among 220 interior defensive linemen and it sure doesn’t seem like the Cowboys feel he’s played any better in training camp. “For a defense that badly needs to improve at stopping the run, an outside addition might be a requirement before Week 1,” Machota adds.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c3b6-db7b-a5dd-e3b683300000</guid>

      <title>The Athletic’s Zac Jackson believes Diontae Johnson “has been outplayed at camp” and may be on the wrong side of the roster bubble.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=00000198-c3d6-dbe3-a9bb-f3d7ed6b0000</link>
      <description>“Even though his role would be different than [new signing Isaiah] Bond’s, that addition doesn’t help his chances, either,” Jackson added. Johnson has been listed behind Jamari Thrash on the depth chart for a bit, and the Browns may be choosing between Johnson and special teams helpers for their end-of-roster spots. Even if he does make the roster, Johnson’s role is so unsettled that he’s hard to trust in fantasy drafts at this point.</description>
