      <title>Malik Washington caught 3-of-3 targets for 48 yards in the Dolphins’ Week 9 loss to the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3866-d673-a39e-bcf7edca0000</link>
      <description>Washington also lost a fourth quarter fumble in a red zone pileup at the Ravens’ 14-yard line. Not ideal. His 48 yards receiving were at least a new season high after he reached that number twice as a rookie. Decent enough, but Washington is still stuck on 3-6 weekly targets even after Tyreek Hill was lost for the season. WR4 value is not materializing. Maybe that will change for Week 10 for a Bills contest where the Dolphins will undoubtedly have to throw more than they would like.</description>

      <title>Ollie Gordon II rushed two times for six yards in the Dolphins’ Week 9 loss to the Ravens before departing with an ankle injury.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3869-d673-a39e-bcf9a4c20000</link>
      <description>Rolled up late in the second quarter, Gordon was announced as “questionable” but never returned despite standing on his own two feet on the sideline. Hopefully he has avoided a high-ankle sprain with 10 days to heal up for Week 10 against the Bills. Before the injury, Gordon slipped and drew a bogus tripping penalty, wiping out a 36-yard Jaylen Waddle grab. The Dolphins have wanted to get Gordon more involved but perpetually poor game scripts is going to make it difficult for the No. 2 back.</description>

      <title>Rashod Bateman caught 2-of-4 targets for 13 yards and a touchdown in the Ravens’ Week 9 win over the Dolphins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3871-d673-a39e-bcf113410000</link>
      <description>The touchdown was nice, but even with Lamar Jackson returning, tonight was the seventh time time in eight 2025 appearances Bateman was held to two-or-fewer catches. The one-time WR4 is now in danger of tumbling out of the top 60 even with Jackson back at the controls following a one-month absence.</description>

      <title>Greg Dulcich caught 5-of-5 targets for 49 yards in the Dolphins’ Week 9 loss to the Ravens.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3873-d713-ad9e-7c7761110000</link>
      <description>Promoted from the practice squad eight days ago after the Dolphins lost Darren Waller to a pec injury, Dulcich wasn’t targeted against the Falcons in Week 8 but surprisingly caught just one fewer pass than each of Jaylen Waddle and De’Von Achane this evening. Although we would like to think it is something to build off of for a former hype merchant who is still only 25 years old, it is far more likely to be a fluke. Dulcich isn’t worth a re-draft FAAB expenditure ahead of Week 10 against the Bills. Maybe you can toss one more Hail Mary in dynasty leagues.</description>

      <title>Keaton Mitchell rushed four times for 11 yards in the Ravens’ Week 9 win over the Dolphins, adding a seven-yard reception.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3877-d713-ad9e-7c770b6c0000</link>
      <description>Five touches for 18 yards is nothing to call home about, but this was the second consecutive week Mitchell out-touched Justice Hill. He was also cutting into Hill’s breather back snaps behind workhorse Derrick Henry. Hunting for sparks as they keep digging out of the hole from their 1-5 start, the Ravens are probably committed to increasing Mitchell’s role at Hill’s expense. Just don’t expect it to turn into 12-team league value any time soon.</description>

      <title>Puka Nacua said he is “ready to go” for Week 9 against the Saints.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3a41-d45b-affe-7fd7a7eb0000</link>
      <description>We still have one day of practice to go, but it sounds like Nacua, who said he feels “fantastic” after Friday’s full practice, is shaping up for a return in Week 9. Head coach Sean McVay said at the start of the week that he expected Nacua to be good to go for this week’s game against the Saints, and things are clearly trending in that direction. We’ll see what happens on Friday, but it wouldn’t be surprising if Nacua was removed from the injury report entirely before the weekend.</description>

      <title>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer said the Chiefs are “drilling down a little more at RB with Isiah Pacheco banged up.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3a65-d713-ad9e-7e75f3610000</link>
      <description>Pacheco is considered “week-to-week” after suffering a sprained MCL in last week’s win over the Commanders. While the injury doesn’t appear to be one that will land him on injured reserve, Breer said the Chiefs could be eyeing a running back, along with a defensive tackle, before next week’s trade deadline. Injury aside, Pacheco has rushed for a pedestrian 78-329-1 on the season and hasn’t gone for more than 58 yards in a game. The number of available running backs at the deadline could be limited, but Breece Hall remains a popular name in the rumor mill, and ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported earlier that theBrowns could be open to dealing Jerome Ford. The trade deadline is set for November 4th, meaning every team, with the exception of those on bye, will get one more look at their rosters to see where things stand before finalizing any decisions.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan said Jauan Jennings (ankle/rib/shoulder) is “getting better” ahead of Week 9’s game against the Giants.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3a94-d713-ad9e-7ed4e7fc0000</link>
      <description>Jennings has been playing through a myriad of injuries throughout most of the season, which has noticeably slowed him on the one. Despite the injury issues, Jennings has been a full participant at practice this week, and Shanahan noted on Thursday that Jennings is “getting better” and is hopeful that the sixth-year receiver will show improved play on the field as he continues to heal. Despite his struggles, Jennings has seen seven or more targets in three of the six games he’s appeared in this season. He remains in play as a WR3/Flex option, with a chance to exceed those expectations if he can bounce back from these injuries.</description>

      <title>The Athletic’s Josh Kendall reports the Falcons “have yet to have any serious trade discussions with another team about Kirk Cousins.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3ab7-d1e7-a1fa-7aff235d0000</link>
      <description>Whether or not the Falcons will deal Cousins to another team has been a discussion ever since Michael Penix took over as QB1 last season. In his first action of 2025 last week, Cousins underwhelmed to the tune of 173 scoreless yards on 31 attempts, although he was far from the only problem the Falcons had on offense against the Dolphins. This lack of “serious trade discussions” regarding the veteran quarterback suggests he’ll be sticking with the team once next week’s trade deadline passes on November 4th barring an unexpected development.</description>

      <title>Jaguars placed WR/CB Travis Hunter (knee) on injured reserve.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-3ac0-d1e7-a1fa-7aea245a0000</link>
      <description>Less than 24 hours after learning that Hunter suffered a knee injury in Thursday’s practice, the two-way player will now miss a minimum of four games because of said injury. Hunter won’t be eligible to return until Week 13 at the earliest and now leaves the Jaguars short on both sides of the ball. The rookie has played on 323 offensive snaps per PFF compared to just 162 defensive snaps, and has seen 209 of his offensive snaps come from the slot. His absence should result in an expanded role for Parker Washington, who enters Week 9 averaging 4.7 targets per game, but could also be supplemented by Dyami Brown (shoulder) who was a full participant in Thursday’s practice. Both players make for interesting stashes heading into a generous Week 9 matchup against the Raiders but shouldn’t be viewed as anything more than WR4/WR5s in fantasy leagues.</description>
