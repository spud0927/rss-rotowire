      <title>The Kansas City Star’s Pete Sweeney reports that Jaguars RB Travis Etienne has “legitimate interest” in signing with the Chiefs in free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-7e2a-d990-a1de-7e6e2d340000</link>
      <description>Etienne will become an unrestricted free agent when free agency officially begins. This would be quite the fun pairing. The Chiefs’ offense, featuring RBs Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco, averaged just 4.2 yards per carry during the regular season, ranking 20th in the NFL. Adding an explosive player like Etienne would be a significant upgrade. Both Hunt and Pacheco are set to become free agents as well.</description>

      <title>Appearing on the Pat McAfee Show, Steelers correspondent Mark Kaboly said to “keep an eye on” Pittsburgh potentially trading for WR Jaylen Waddle.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-80b0-d89c-a1be-afff4d000000</link>
      <description>Kaboly went as far as saying the Steelers believed they had a deal done for Waddle before last season’s trade deadline. While adding another wide receiver to go along with D.K. Metcalf seems to be a priority for the Steelers, it ultimately takes two teams to make a trade. Pittsburgh’s pursuit of Waddle before last year’s trade deadline came up short and NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reported on Friday that the Dolphins aren’t interested in trading Waddle this offseason. That could also be posturing by the Dolphins to get better trade offers. If truly available, Waddle will be one of the big names to watch at the NFL Combine next week.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah told reporters the Lions have “been sniffing around” free agent tackles.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-80c7-d042-afbc-fdd76ec40000</link>
      <description>With Taylor Decker considering retirement after 10 seasons with the Lions, it’s no surprise the team is preparing in case the 31-year-old indeed decides to call it quits. While the Lions could address their long-term need at tackle with their first round pick, which is 17th overall, the organization will certainly sign a free agent tackle before then if Decker retires. The Lions are approaching this situation proactively after center Frank Ragnow retired late last offseason, which left the team unprepared. Braden Smith, Rasheed Walker, Trent Brown and Jermaine Eluemunor are some of the free agent tackles that could make sense for the Lions.</description>

      <title>Ravens TE Isaiah Likely said “business is business” when talking about his free agency.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-81fe-d042-afbc-fdfef2a80000</link>
      <description>Speaking to Jon Gruden onGruden Goes Long, Ravens tight end Isaiah Likely said he wants to “be able to blossom” moving forward. He added that he would like to return to Baltimore, a place he considers “home,” but was upfront with the fact that “business is business” as he works his way through his first free agency of his career. “I just want to be on a team where I can get out there and help a quarterback, help a team be able to put as much points on the board as possible,” Likely concluded. We’ll need to see how the coming months play out, but it certainly appears as if Likely is preparing to find a new home on the open market for the 2027 season.</description>

      <title>Cowboys signed RB Javonte Williams to a three-year, $24 million contract.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-8204-d042-afbc-ffd677890000</link>
      <description>The deal includes $16 million in guaranteed money and ties the veteran back to the Cowboys through the 2028 season. Coming off a career year, Williams remains with the Cowboys after playing the 2025 season on a one-year, “prove it” deal. The value on the contract is the same as was recently signed by Bears running back D’Andre Swift, making Williams the 16th highest paid back in the league on an average annual value basis. Expect Williams to enter the 2026 regular season as a borderline workhorse after handling 252 carries and seeing 51 targets in 16 healthy games a season ago.</description>

      <title>Browns Beat Reporter reports LB Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah is “doubtful to ever to return to the field.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-826a-d990-a1de-ee6e116d0000</link>
      <description>Owusu-Koramoah suffered a terrifying neck injury in 2024 and missed the entirety of the 2025 season while recovering from the injury. It now appears as if his days of playing competitive football are done. It’s an unfortunate situation for the former Pro Bowl linebacker but he at least appears to have recovered from the injury enough to lead a normal life.</description>

      <title>WLKY Louisville reports Vikings WR Rondale Moore has passed away at the age of 25.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-8305-d89c-a1be-afdf1dbb0000</link>
      <description>Moore passed away Saturday in New Albany, Ind. The Vikings have confirmed his death. Devastatingly, the New Albany police chief said Moore is believed to have taken his own life, but an autopsy has been scheduled for Sunday. The 25-year-old spent the 2025 season on Minnesota’s injured reserve after doing the same for the Falcons in 2024. The No. 49 overall pick of the 2021 draft, Moore was a high school and college sensation despite his 5-foot-7 frame. His NFL career was sadly beset by injury, but he still caught 135 passes across 39 games, and was a factor on special teams. Our thoughts are with Moore’s family, friends, and teammates.</description>

      <title>NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reports Alabama QB Ty Simpson will throw at the NFL Combine.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-85ad-d629-a1bc-b5bd431a0000</link>
      <description>Simpson will be looking to shore up the QB2 ranking in the class. The Alabama quarterback came out of nowhere last year with a conference-leading 473 attempts for 3,567 yards, 28 touchdowns, and five interceptions. Simpson had thrown just 50 passes in his first three seasons as Tuscaloosa. Scouts will want to get as deep of a look as they can at Simpson, so it makes plenty of sense for him to throw at the combine.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Michael DiRocco believes Brian Thomas Jr.'s stats “may not reach what they were in 2024.”</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-85b4-d042-afbc-fdf659e50000</link>
      <description>Rest assured that Thomas will be “a key piece of head coach Liam Cohen’s offense,” but DiRocco seems to believe that Thomas’ complementary role will endure in 2026. DiRocco also notes that Thomas looked uncomfortable in training camp, setting the scene for an ugly early-season run. Thomas has had plenty of trade buzz from the outside this offseason, but a trade probably relies on another team evaluating him at his 2024 level rather than his 2025 level. If he remains in Jacksonville, it’s hard to count on him as more than a WR3 pick in 2026.</description>

      <title>ESPN’s Rich Cimini believes the Cardinals could be a “potential suitor” for RB Breece Hall.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019c-85cf-d629-a1bc-b5df04b70000</link>
      <description>Cimini connects these dots through new head coach Mike LaFleur, who coached Hall with the Jets. Arizona’s backfield is in a major state of flux after all of last season’s backs (James Conner, Trey Benson, Zonovan Knight) suffered season-ending injuries. It’s a vacuum where Hall would make sense. Cimini believes the Jets would like to extend Hall before he hits the open market, but may wind up using the franchise or transition tags instead — or on the way to — a deal.</description>
