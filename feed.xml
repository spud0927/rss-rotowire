      <title>Bears coach Ben Johnson said Luther Burden is in concussion protocol.</title>

      <description>The potential absence of both Burden and Olamide Zaccheaus (knee, day-to-day) might drive the Bears to use more Colston Loveland next week against the Bengals. FLEX-hungry fantasy managers should keep in touch with Chicago’s injury report later this week to see what comes of these wideout injuries.</description>

      <title>Carson Wentz will undergo surgery on his left shoulder, ending his season.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-2773-dab4-a3fb-bf73a8af0000</link>
      <description>The Athletic’s Dianna Russini was the first to report the news. Wentz’s injury is to his non-throwing shoulder, but after further evaluation of his injury, it was decided that surgery would be the best option to correct things. Wentz stepped up to start in five games for the Vikings this season after J.J. McCarthy suffered an ankle injury in Week 2. Wentz’s season ends with a 1,216-6-5 line through the air, with four of his touchdowns coming in Weeks 3 and 4. The veteran quarterback signed a one-year deal with the Vikings this offseason and will likely have a chance to earn a backup role somewhere in 2026 once he is back to full strength. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport later reported that Wentz “suffered a dislocation that tore his labrum and fractured the socket” in the Vikings’ Week 6 game against the Browns, and then gutted it out for two more weeks.</description>

      <title>Falcons HC Raheem Morris said Michael Penix (knee) will be day-to-day.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-2781-dab4-a3fb-bff160060000</link>
      <description>Penix practiced in the days leading up to Week 8’s game against the Dolphins but was ultimately ruled out in favor of Kirk Cousins. The second-year quarterback is one of several Falcons players who are day-to-day to start the week, as Morris also said S Jessie Bates (ankle), DL Zach Harrison (knee), CB Billy Bowman (hamstring), and EDGE Jalon Walker (groin) would also be day-to-day to open the week. Penix appears to be trending in the right direction but if he’s unable to go, Cousins would again draw the start on the road against the Patriots.</description>

      <title>Falcons HC Raheem Morris said Drake London (hip) will be day-to-day.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-278c-dab4-a3fb-bffc7d840000</link>
      <description>London was a late addition to the team’s injury report last week and ended up being ruled out before Sunday’s game against the Dolphins. We don’t know much about the severity of his injury, but London was initially removed from the injury report before being added back to it over the weekend and then ruled out. It’s clear the team was hoping he could play through it, so it’s also possible the decision to sit him on Sunday was more so out of precaution. His day-to-day status to open the week suggests he’ll have a good chance of playing in Week 9 against the Patriots.</description>

      <title>Cardinals released RB Michael Carter.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-278f-d5d8-a3ff-ffefaa480000</link>
      <description>Fired on his day off. Carter drew the start for the Cardinals in Weeks 5 and 6, and rushed for 18-51-2 in Week 5 against the Titans. Despite the volume, it was a relatively underwhelming day from an efficiency standpoint, which led to him being out-touched by Zonovan Knight the following week. The Cardinals clearly didn’t love what Carter had to offer — or not offer — to a running back room in need of help with James Connor and Trey Benson both sidelined. Zonovan Knight now figures to see a lead role for the Cardinals in Week 9 when they take on a Cowboys defense that has been vulnerable on the ground. Knight could be a volume-based RB2 play in what looks like a plus matchup on paper.</description>

      <title>Dre Greenlaw is eligible to return from suspension in Week 9 against the Texans.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-27a7-deb1-a39b-27af9b2b0000</link>
      <description>Greenlaw served his one-game suspension for verbally threatening a referee after the Broncos’ Week 7 comeback win against the Giants. Greenlaw was sidelined for Week 8 as a result of his actions, but should be back and in the starting lineup next week when the Broncos visit the Texans.</description>

      <title>Ravens HC John Harbaugh said he is “very confident” in QB Lamar Jackson being available for Thursday Night Football against the Dolphins.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-27b7-d245-adfb-b7ff61c50000</link>
      <description>Speaking to media Monday, Harbaugh stated that he was “very confident” in the perennial MVP’s status for Week 9 against the Dolphins on Thursday Night Football. The team has yet to release their initial injury report but it certainly sounds like Jackson is in line to return from a three-game absence, during which the team went 1-2. The improbable win over the Bears kept the team within striking distance in the AFC North, now two games behind the division-leading Steelers. A late-season surge is not out of the question in Baltimore, and a return from Jackson could be just what the team needs to make a run at the playoffs during the second half of the season.</description>

      <title>49ers HC Kyle Shanahan said “it’s too early to say” whether QB Brock Purdy will play in Week 9.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-27c8-dab4-a3fb-bff8a80f0000</link>
      <description>Shanahan didn’t close the door on a potential return to the game-day roster for Purdy but also wasn’t overly confident in Purdy’s status, adding that the team would “see how he’s doing on Wednesday.” Purdy has appeared in just two games this season as he battles a turf toe injury but appears to be inching closer to a return. The 5-2 49ers fell a half game behind both the Seahawks and Rams with the loss in Week 8 to the Texans but remain in a position for a late-season surge towards the playoffs. Fantasy managers will want to track the veteran starter’s status when the team releases their first injury report of the week Wednesday.</description>

      <title>Commanders declared QB Jayden Daniels, CB Noah Igbinoghene, K Matt Gay, LB Ale Kaho, T Trent Scott, T George Fant, and TE Colson Yankoff inactive for Week 8 against the Chiefs.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-27cd-d5d8-a3ff-ffed57380000</link>
      <description>Marcus Mariota will start under center for the Commanders for the third time this season after one win and one loss. The Commanders find themselves on the outs in the playoff picture as the midway point in the season approaches, badly needing a win against the surging Chiefs. They will also be without their place kicker as Matt Gay is unable to go.</description>

      <title>Chiefs declared CB Kristian Fulton, WR Jalen Royals, TE Jared Wiley, RB Elijah Mitchell, G Trey Smith, T Josh Simmons, and DE Malik Herring inactive for Week 8 against the Commanders.</title>
      <link>https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news?playerNewsId=0000019a-27de-dab4-a3fb-bffe04a60000</link>
      <description>The offensive linemen were ruled out earlier in the week, something that could expose quarterback Patrick Mahomes to unwanted pressure against a Commanders defense blitzing at the fifth highest frequency this season. Fulton remains sidelined while Mitchell continues to be the odd man out in the backfield.</description>
